  abstract  = {Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is an analytical technique that measures the change in kinetic energy of electrons after they have interacted with a specimen. When carried out in a modern transmission electron microscope, EELS is capable of giving structural and chemical information about a solid, with a spatial resolution down to the atomic level in favourable cases. The energy resolution is typically 1 eV but can approach 0.1 eV if an electron-beam monochromator is used. This review provides an overview of EELS instrumentation and of the physics involved in the scattering of kilovolt electrons in solids. Features of the energy-loss spectrum are discussed, including plasmon peaks, inner-shell ionization edges and fine structure related to the electronic densities of states. Examples are given of the use of EELS for the measurement of local properties, including specimen thickness, mechanical and electronic properties (such as bandgap) and chemical composition. Factors that determine the spatial resolution of the analysis are outlined, including radiation damage to the specimen. Comparisons are made with related techniques, particularly x-ray absorption spectroscopy.}

abstract = {Spectrometers and energy filters for electron energy-loss spectroscopy and electron spectroscopic imaging in transmission electron microscopy have a long history. The first commercial post-column imaging energy filter became available already in the early 1990s. Since then this technique has become an important tool for analytic electron microscopy. Nevertheless, the imaging performance of post-column energy-filters is undoubtedly inferior compared to in-column energy filters and their principal design is clearly restricted by practical constraints we found that significant improvements with respect to optical performance and alignment flexibility are still possible compared to the presently available instrumentation. By applying calculation methods originally developed for the design of aberration correctors and spending much care on the precise design of the optical elements and the alignment strategies we could develop a new post-column imaging energy filter with a minimalistic and robust optical design but remarkable optical properties. Compared to other state-of-the-art devices in our design the aberrations determining the energy resolution are reduced by one order of magnitude for the same entrance aperture. Therefore, if desirable, the field of view can be enlarged by more than a factor of two in area while the optical aberrations stay comparable or even better. We describe the principal optical design of the CEOS Energy-Filtering and Imaging Device (CEFID), explain methods for aberration measurement and optical characterization, and finally demonstrate its optical performance by measured imaging and spectroscopy data from two prototype systems.}

abstract = {Exploiting the information provided by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) requires reliable access to the low-loss region where the zero-loss peak (ZLP) often overwhelms the contributions associated to inelastic scatterings off the specimen. Here we deploy machine learning techniques developed in particle physics to realise a model-independent, multidimensional determination of the ZLP with a faithful uncertainty estimate. This novel method is then applied to subtract the ZLP for EEL spectra acquired in flower-like WS2 nanostructures characterised by a 2H/3R mixed polytypism. From the resulting subtracted spectra we determine the nature and value of the bandgap of polytypic WS2, finding EBG=1.6−0.2+0.3eV with a clear preference for an indirect bandgap. Further, we demonstrate how this method enables us to robustly identify excitonic transitions down to very small energy losses. Our approach has been implemented and made available in an open source Python package dubbed EELSfitter.}

It is found that all the molecules are physisorbed on the InSe monolayer surface and act as electron acceptors for the InSe, except NH3 which is found to be an electron donor. Furthermore, for most of the molecules studied, the adsorption cannot induce obvious changes in the band structures near the Fermi level compared with those of the pristine InSe monolayer. However, it is noted that the adsorbed InSe monolayers have new in-gap states induced by the open-shell molecules (NO2, NO, and O2), which may trigger some new effects on the optical properties of the materials. Our theoretical findings suggest that two-dimensional InSe nanomaterials hold great promise for fabricating gas sensors based on a physisorption-based charge transfer mechanism.}

abstract = {Energy filtering transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) is a widely used technique in many areas of scientific research. Image contrast in energy-filtered images arises from specific scattering events such as the ionization of atoms. By combining a set of two or more images, relative sample thickness maps or elemental distribution maps can be easily created. It is also possible to acquire a whole series of energy-filtered images to do more complex data analysis. However, whenever several images are combined to extract certain information, problems are introduced due to sample drift between the exposures. In order to obtain artifact-free information, this spatial drift has to be taken care of. Manual alignment by overlaying and shifting the images to find the best overlap is usually very accurate but extremely time consuming for larger data sets. When large amounts of images are recorded in an EFTEM series, manual correction is no longer a reasonable option. Hence, automatic routines have been developed that are mostly based on the cross-correlation algorithm. Existing routines, however, sometimes fail and again make time consuming manual adjustments necessary. In this paper we describe a new approach to the drift correction problem by incorporating a statistical treatment of the data and we present our statistically determined spatial drift (SDSD) correction program. We show its improved performance by applying it to a typical EFTEM series data block.}

  abstract = {Stacking monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides into a heterostructure with a finite twist-angle gives rise to artificial moir\'e superlattices with a tunable periodicity. As a consequence, excitons experience a periodic potential, which can be exploited to tailor optoelectronic properties of these materials. Whereas recent experimental studies have confirmed twistangle-dependent optical spectra, the microscopic origin of moir\'e exciton resonances has not been fully clarified yet. Here, we combine first-principles calculations with the excitonic density matrix formalism to study transitions between different moir\'e exciton phases and their impact on optical properties of the twisted MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure. At angles smaller than 2\textdegree, we find flat, moire{\'-} trapped states for inter- and intralayer excitons. This moir\'e exciton phase changes into completely delocalized states at 3\textdegree. We predict a linear and quadratic twist-angle dependence of excitonic resonances for the moire{\'-} trapped and delocalized exciton phases, respectively.},

Moreover, controlling the positioning of two-dimensional crystals facilitates their integration in complex devices, which enables the exploration of novel applications and the discovery of new phenomena in these materials. To date, deterministic transfer methods rely on the use of sacrificial polymer layers and wet chemistry to some extent. Here, we develop an all-dry transfer method that relies on viscoelastic stamps and does not employ any wet chemistry step. This is found to be very advantageous to freely suspend these materials as there are no capillary forces involved in the process. Moreover, the whole fabrication process is quick, efficient, clean and it can be performed with high yield.},

The maps are calculated and displayed in real time, along with conventional annular dark-field images, through the use of customdeveloped hardware and software. An increased electric field is observed around boron monovacancies and subsequently mapped and measured relative to the perfect lattice. The edges of extended defects feature enhanced electric fields, which can be used to trap diffusing adatoms. The magnitude of the electric field produced by the different types of edges is compared to monolayer areas, confirming previous predictions regarding their stability.

Here, ultrastable electron-optics are combined with a high-speed 2D electron detector to map electrostatic fields around individual atoms in 2D monolayers using 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy.

The disappearance of acid or alkali from the mucosal solution of short-circuited tissue was measured with a pH stat while the serosal pH was kept at 7.4. The duodenum rapidly disposed of both acid and alkali; neither property was altered by gassing with N2 while iodoacetate was in the perfusing solutions. Prevention of release of CO2 from the mucosal chamber obliterated the early rapid phase of acid disposal by the mucosa while a similar maneuver in the serosal chamber increased the appearance of serosal acid without altering the rate of acid disposal. Gut sacs of rabbit duodenum in vitro and in vivo showed a positive correlation between acid disposal and the rate of luminal CO2 production. While acid disposal progressively decreased with time for the in vitro gut sacs, the in vivo gut sac showed no fatigue in this respect. Luminal acidification in the Ussing chamber was associated with a profound reduction in short-circuit current (Isc), partially reversible by elevation of the mucosal pH but not by luminal glucose. Our data suggest that acid disposal occurs in part by intraluminal neutralization and in part by diffusion into the mucosa.},

The presence of interlayer excitons, where the electron and the hole remain spatially separated in the two layers due to ultrafast charge transfer, is an intriguing feature of these heterostructures. The optoelectronic functionality of 2D heterostructure devices is critically dependent on the relative rotation angle of the layers. However, the role of the relative rotation angle of the constituent layers on intralayer absorption is not clear yet. Here, we investigate MoS2/WSe2 vdW heterostructures using monochromated low-loss electron energy loss (EEL) spectroscopy combined with aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and report that momentum conservation is a critical factor in the intralayer absorption of TMDC vdW heterostructures. The evolution of the intralayer excitonic low-loss EEL spectroscopy peak broadenings as a function of the rotation angle reveals that the interlayer charge transfer rate can be about an order of magnitude faster in the aligned (or anti-aligned) case than in the misaligned cases. These results provide a deeper insight into the role of momentum conservation, one of the fundamental principles governing charge transfer dynamics in 2D vdW heterostructures.},

  abstract = {Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) excels in accessing atomic-scale structure and chemistry. Enhancing our ability to directly image the functionalities of local features in materials has become one of the most important topics in the future development of STEM. Recently, differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging has been utilized to map the internal electric and magnetic fields in materials from nanoscale features such as p\textendash n junctions, skyrmions, and even from individual atoms. Here, we use an ultra-low noise SCMOS detector in as the diffraction plane camera to collect four-dimensional (4D) datasets. The high angular resolution, efficient high-SNR acquisition, and modifiability of the camera allow it to function as a universal detector, where STEM imaging configurations, such as DPC, bright field, annular bright field, and annular dark field can all be reconstructed from a single 4D dataset. By examining a distorted perovskite, \-DyScO3, which possesses projected lattice spacings as small as 0.83 \AA, we demonstrate DPC spatial resolution almost reaching the information limit of a 100 keV electron beam. In addition, the perovskite has ordered O-coordinations with alternating octahedral tilts, which can be quantitatively measured with single degree accuracy by taking advantage of DPC's sensitivity to light atoms. The results, acquired on a standard Ronchigram camera as opposed to a specialized DPC detector, open up new opportunities to understand and design functional materials and devices that involve lattice and charge coupling at nano- and atomic-scales.},

Significant energy shifts are observed in tunneling spectra observed at the maxima of the moir\'e corrugation, as compared with spectra obtained at corrugation minima, consistent with prior work. Furthermore, at the minima of the moir\'e corrugation, sharp peaks in the spectra at energies near the band edges are observed for spectra acquired at 5 K. The peaks correspond to discrete states that are confined within the moir\'e unit cells. Conductance mapping is employed to reveal the detailed structure of the wave functions of the states.

  abstract = {Twisted van der Waals heterostructures are known to induce surprisingly diverse and intriguing phenomena, such as correlated electronic phase and unconventional optical properties. This can be realized by controlled rotation of adjacent atomic planes, which provides an uncommon way to manipulate inelastic light-matter interactions. Here, we discover an extraordinary blue shift of 5-6 wavenumbers for high-frequency phonon modes in WS2/WSe2 twisted heterobilayers, captured meticulously using Raman spectroscopy. Phonon spectra displace rapidly over a subtle change in interlayer twist angle owing to heterostrain and atomic reconstruction from the Moir\'e pattern. First-order linear coefficients of the phonon modes in twisted heterostructures are further found to increase largely compared to their monolayer counterpart and vary immensely with the twist angle. Exceptional and extravagant enhancement of up to 50-fold is observed in the Raman vibrational intensity at a specific twist angle; this is largely influenced by the resonance process derived from a simple critical twist angle model. In addition, we depict how the resonance can be modulated by changing the thermal conditions and also the stacking angle. Therefore, our work further highlights the twist-driven phonon dynamics in pristine two-dimensional heterostructures, adding vital insight into Moir\'e physics and promoting comprehensive understanding of structural and optical properties in Moir\'e superlattices.},

  abstract = {Isolated atomic planes can be assembled into a multilayer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure in a precisely chosen sequence. These heterostructures feature moir\'e patterns if the constituent 2D material layers are stacked in an incommensurable way, due to a lattice mismatch or twist. This design-by-stacking has opened up the promising area of moir\'e engineering, a term that can be understood in two different perspectives, namely, (i) structural\textemdash engineering a moir\'e pattern by introducing twist, relative strain, or defects that affect the commensurability of the layers and (ii) functional\textemdash exploiting a moir\'e pattern to find and tune resulting physical properties of a vdW heterostructure. The latter meaning, referring to the application of a moir\'e pattern, is seen in the literature in the specific context of the observation of correlated electronic states and unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene. The former meaning, referring to the design of the moir\'e pattern itself, is present in the literature but less commonly discussed or less understood. The underlying link between these two perspectives lies in the deformation field of the moir\'e superlattice. In this Perspective, we describe a path from designing a moir\'e pattern to employing the moir\'e pattern to tune physical properties of a vdW heterostructure. We also discuss the concept of moir\'e engineering in the context of twistronics, strain engineering, and defect engineering in vdW heterostructures. Although twistronics is always associated with moir\'e superlattices, strain and defect engineering are often not. Here, we demonstrate how strain and defect engineering can be understood within the context of moir\'e engineering. Adopting this perspective, we note that moir\'e engineering creates a compelling opportunity to design and develop multiscale electronic devices.},

Here, we report experimental measurements of the structure and spectroscopic properties of twisted bilayers of WSe2 and MoSe2 in the H-stacking configuration using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Our experiments reveal that the moir\textbackslash 'e potential in these bilayers at small angles is unexpectedly large, reaching values of above 300 meV for the valence band and 150 meV for the conduction band - an order of magnitude larger than theoretical estimates based on interlayer coupling alone. We further demonstrate that the moir\textbackslash 'e potential is a non-monotonic function of moir\textbackslash 'e wavelength, reaching a maximum at around a 13nm moir\textbackslash 'e period. This non-monotonicity coincides with a drastic change in the structure of the moir\textbackslash 'e pattern from a continuous variation of stacking order at small moir\textbackslash 'e wavelengths to a one-dimensional soliton dominated structure at large moir\textbackslash 'e wavelengths. We show that the in-plane structure of the moir\textbackslash 'e pattern is captured well by a continuous mechanical relaxation model, and find that the moir\textbackslash 'e structure and internal strain rather than the interlayer coupling is the dominant factor in determining the moir\textbackslash 'e potential.

  abstract = {Edge structures are low-dimensional defects unavoidable in layered materials of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) family. Among the various types of such structures, the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) edge types are the most common. It has been predicted that the presence of intrinsic strain localized along these edges structures can have direct implications for the customization of their electronic properties. However, pinning down the relation between local structure and electronic properties at these edges is challenging. Here, we quantify the local strain field that arises at the edges of MoS2 flakes by combining aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with the geometrical-phase analysis (GPA) method. We also provide further insight on the possible effects of such edge strain on the resulting electronic behavior by means of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements. Our results reveal that the two-dominant edge structures, ZZ and AC, induce the formation of different amounts of localized strain fields. We also show that by varying the free edge curvature from concave to convex, compressive strain turns into tensile strain. These results pave the way toward the customization of edge structures in MoS2, which can be used to engineer the properties of layered materials and thus contribute to the optimization of the next generation of atomic-scale electronic devices built upon them.},

Sub-nanometer 1D features in the 2D electric field maps are observed at the outermost region along zigzag edges and also along nanowire MoS-terminated MoS2 edges. Atomic-scale oscillations are detected in the magnitude of the 1D electromagnetic edge state, with spatial variations that depend on the specific periodic edge reconstructions. Electric field reconstructions, along with integrated differential phase contrast reconstructions, reveal the presence of low Z number atoms terminating many of the uniform edges, which are difficult to detect by annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy due to its limited dynamic range. Density functional theory calculations support the formation of periodic 1D edge states and also show that enhancement of the electric field magnitude can occur for some edge terminations. The experimentally observed electric fields at the edges are attributed to the absence of an opposing electric field from a nearest neighbor atom when the electron beam propagates through the 2D monolayer and interacts. These results show the potential of 4D-STEM to map the atomic scale structure and fluctuations of electric fields around edge atoms with different bonding states than bulk atoms in 2D materials, beyond conventional imaging.},

The influence of twist angle on the excitonic absorption of twisted bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe\$\_\{2\}\$) has been investigated using electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Atomic-resolution imaging by scanning transmission electron microscopy was used to determine key structural parameters, including the nanoscale measurement of the relative twist angle and stacking order. Detailed spectral analysis revealed a pronounced blueshift in the high-energy excitonic peak C with increasing twist angle, up to 200 meV when compared to the AA\$\^\{\textbackslash prime\}\$ stacking.

We further show that the local bandgap is periodically modulated in the               X               -               Y               direction with an amplitude of \textasciitilde 0.15 eV, leading to the formation of a two-dimensional electronic superlattice.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Moir\'e lattices formed in twisted van der Waals bilayers provide a unique, tunable platform to realize coupled electron or exciton lattices unavailable before. While twist angle between the bilayer has been shown to be a critical parameter in engineering the moir\'e potential and enabling novel phenomena in electronic moir\'e systems, a systematic experimental study as a function of twist angle is still missing. Here we show that not only are moir\'e excitons robust in bilayers of even large twist angles, but also properties of the moir\'e excitons are dependant on, and controllable by, the moir\'e reciprocal lattice period via twist-angle tuning. From the twist-angle dependence, we furthermore obtain the effective mass of the interlayer excitons and the electron inter-layer tunneling strength, which are difficult to measure experimentally otherwise. These findings pave the way for understanding and engineering rich moir\'e-lattice induced phenomena in angle-twisted semiconductor van der Waals heterostructures.},

  abstract = {A secondary moir\'e is developed to solve the measurement error caused by too dense moir\'e when evaluating atomic lattice quality.           ,                             STEM nano-moir\'e can achieve high-precision deformation measurement in a large field of view. In scanning moir\'e fringe technology, the scanning line and magnification of the existing transmission electron microscope (TEM) cannot be changed continuously. The frequency of the crystal lattice is often difficult to match with the fixed frequency of the scanning line, resulting in mostly too dense fringes that cannot be directly observed; thus, the calculation error is relatively large. This problem exists in both the STEM moir\'e method and the multiplication moir\'e method. Herein, we propose the STEM secondary nano-moir\'e method,               i.e.               , a digital grating of similar frequency is superimposed on or sampling the primary moir\'e fringe or multiplication moir\'e to form the secondary moir\'e. The formation principle of the secondary moir\'e is analyzed in detail, with deduced theoretical relations for measuring the strain of STEM secondary nano-moir\'e fringe. The advantages of sampling secondary moir\'e and digital secondary moir\'e are compared. The optimal sampling interpolation function is obtained through error analysis. This method expands the application range of the STEM moir\'e method and has better practicability. Finally, the STEM secondary nano-moir\'e is used to accurately measure the strain field at the Si/Ge heterostructure interface, and the theoretical strain field calculated by the dislocation model is analyzed and compared. The obtained results are more compatible with the P\textendash N dislocation model. Our work provides a practical method for the accurate evaluation of the interface characteristics of heterostructures, which is an important basis for judging the photoelectric performance of the entire device and the optimal design of the heterostructures.},

  abstract = {A general Moir\'e-templated nanoscale morphology engineering method.           ,                             To take full advantage of the electronic properties of transition-metal dichalcogenides and their vdW layered structures, it will be necessary to control the local electronic structure, on which the effect of lattice deformation is significant. Nevertheless, a general approach to programming nanoscale morphology in TMD materials, which would permit local strain engineering, has proven elusive. In this work, we propose a general moir\'e-templated nanoscale morphology engineering method based on bilayer TMDs. The moir\'e superlattice plays the key role in enforcing in-plane periodical variations in local interlayer spacing and potential energy. Upon global in-plane compression, the high-energy, large-interlayer-separation stacking domains serve as periodic buckling initiation sites. The buckled features can be thus precisely correlated to the moir\'e periodicity. The spatial profile of the buckled morphology and strain field are possible to be pre-determined, providing a bridge to the electronics and optoelectronics design. We take twisted bilayer MoS               2               to demonstrate our approach. We further demonstrate how the morphology can modulate band gap and optical absorption of a MoS               2               monolayer, envisioned as a potential constituent layer in a Moir\'e-templated, strain-engineered vdW heterostructure of TMDs. The robustness and programmable nature of our approach arise from superlattice symmetry, energetics and mechanics. Our approach provides a new strategy for on-demand design of morphology and local strain in TMDs under mechanical deformation.},
