\label{sec:COM}
%
In the context of electron diffraction, the Bragg condition, as described by Bragg's law, play a crucial role. It states that the interference of waves becomes constructive when the path difference between them is an integer multiple of the wavelength. This fundamental principle leads to the formation of Bragg diffraction spots or disks, which are the prominent features in the diffraction pattern.

%
Centre-of-mass (COM) analysis is an innovation approach to potential field mapping and phase object retrieval. 
%
It serves as a continuation of differential phase contrast, where a segmented annular detector is utilised to measure the difference in beam intensity on two pairs of opposing detectors. 
%
This methodology offers valuable insights into the deflection of electrons caused by the sample. 
%
By employing the COM technique, we can effectively  retrieve phase information. 
%
Furthermore, this approach has evolved to accommodate pixelated-array detectors, enabling the capture of the first moment of the electron beam on the detector plane. 

The central Bragg diffraction spot or disk is often described as unscattered, but this is a simplification. 
%
While it is true that the spot/disk is not scattered by the crystal structure, it can be deflected from its  unperturbed position by angles much smaller than the Bragg angles. 
%
These deflections occur as a result of the phase acquired by the electrons in the beam during their interaction with electric or magnetic fields.

This shift in position is detectable only when the electron probe is physically much smaller than the electric or magnetic field with which it interacts.
%
Conversely,if the probe is much larger than the probed feature, one instead observed a redistribution of the intensity within the bright field disk.
%
Both these scenarios necessitate different analysis processes.

However, they both start from the same assumption: that the electron probe wavefunction $\psi_{in}(\vec{k})$ interacts with a sample that can be modelled as a pure phase object. This interaction only adds a phase component to the incoming wavefunction\cite{caoTheoryPracticeElectron2018, lazicPhaseContrastSTEM2016}. 

The outgoing wavefunction of the electron probe can be described as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \Psi_{out}(\vec{r},\vec{r}_p)=\psi_{in}(\vec{r}-\vec{r}_p)\exp(2\pi i \Delta \vec{k})\\
    \label{eq:out_wav}
\end{equation}

Here, $\vec{r}_p$ denotes the position of the probe, $\Delta k$ represents the phase shift, and, $\psi_{in}$ is the incoming wave modelled as a plane wave. The semi-convergence angle of this plane wave is imposed by an aperture $A(\vec{k})$.

The incoming wave is given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
    \psi_{in}(\vec{r})=\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\{A(\vec{k})\exp(i\chi(\vec{k}))\right\}(\vec{r})
    \label{eq:in_wav}
\end{equation}

%\subsubsection{Probe << Features}

    \caption{\textbf{Left:} When electron probes have crossover areas much smaller than the features being imaged, the entire diffracted outgoing wavefunction is subjected to complete deflection. \textbf{Right:} This deflection becomes evident through a uniform translation on the imaging plane, as indicated by the arrow highlighting the shift from the centre.}
	\label{fig:small_probe}
\end{figure}
%-------------------------------------------------------

In the scenario where the probe's cross-sectional area is much smaller than the feature being imaged, it can be assumed that the sample potential is a linear ramp across the probe's cross-sectional area ~\cite{caoTheoryPracticeElectron2018}. 
%
At the detectors, the magnitude of the Fourier transformed wavefunction is measured. The phase shift in real space is then transformed into a displacement in reciprocal space.
%
The displacement in reciprocal space is linearly dependent on the electric and/or magnetic field. The final diffraction pattern recorded on a sensor in STEM imaging is then given by Equation~\ref{eq:lin_shift}, where $t$ is the thickness of the sample, $\sigma$ and $\mu$ are the interaction parameters for the perpendicular electric $\vec{E}_{\perp}$ and magnetic field $\vec{B}_{\perp}$ respectively, and are equal to $m\cdot e \lambda / h^ 2$ and $e / h$. 

Figure~\ref{fig:small_probe} displays the expected displacement of the wavefunction on the sensor surface.

\begin{equation}
    \vert \Psi(\vec{k},\vec{r}_p)\vert^2 = \vert \psi_{in}(\vec{k}-t(\sigma \vec{E}_{\perp}+\mu \vec{B}_{\perp}))\vert^2
    \label{eq:lin_shift}
\end{equation}


%\subsubsection{Probe >> Features}
%-------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\def\svgwidth{1\linewidth}
    \import{resources/Figures}{probe_bigg_features_smol.pdf_tex}
	\caption{}
	\label{fig:big_boii_probe}
\end{figure}
%-------------------------------------------------------
In the case where the probe is much larger than the feature, it can be assumed that the potential interacting with the probe is a delta potential, and only weakly affects the probe. The outgoing wavefunction can then be modelled as follows: 

\begin{equation}
    \Psi_{out}(\vec{r},\vec{r}_p)=\psi_{in}(\vec{r}-\vec{r}_p)\left[ 1+2\pi i \Delta \vec{k}\delta(\vec{r})\right]
    \label{eq:prob_smol_out}
\end{equation}

By taking the Fourier transform, the magnitude of the diffraction pattern on the sensor's imaging plane is defined as 

\begin{equation}
    \vert \Psi_{out}(\vec{k},\vec{r}_p)\vert^2 = \vert A(\vec{k})\vert^2-4\pi \Delta \vec{k} A(\vec{k})P(\vec{r})\sin(r) + \vert 2\pi\Delta \vec{k}\vert^2 \psi_{in}(\vec{r})\psi^*_{in}(\vec{r})
    \label{eq:prob_smol_diff}
\end{equation}

where $P(r)$ is the inverse Fourier transform of our aperture function $A(\vec{k})$.
%
In this approximation, the outgoing wavefunction has only two terms whose contribution affects the intensity of the bright field disk. The aperture function $A(\vec{k})$ in Equation~\ref{eq:prob_smol_diff} restricts the intensity in the bright field disk to an image of the incoming probe wavefunction and a redistribution due to the phase acquired. 
%
In this scenario, the COM can be measured by looking at the first moment within the bright field disk instead of the displacement of this disk. 

\section{Interpretation of centre-of-mass images}
%
In both previously described scenarios, it is possible to measure the COM as the first moment of the intensity of the diffraction pattern on the sensor. For every probe position $\vec{r}_p$ over the sample, a vector with an $x$ and $y$ coordinate of the COM is recorded. This is given by the equation:

\begin{equation}
    I^{COM}_{i} (\vec{r}_p) = \iint_{-\infty}^{\infty} k_{i} I_D(\vec{k}, \vec{r}_p) \mathrm{d}^2\vec{k} = \iint_{-\infty}^{\infty}k_i \vert \Psi_{out}(\vec{k},\vec{r}_p)\vert^2 \mathrm{d}^2 \vec{k}; \qquad i = x,y
    \label{eq:com_int}
\end{equation}

The vector-valued image $\vec{I}^{COM}(\vec{r}_p)$ is not only proportional to the electric or magnetic field in the sample but also to the gradient of the phase object $\vec{\nabla}\phi(\vec{r})$ of the image~ \cite{lazicPhaseContrastSTEM2016}.

By integrating the $\vec{I}^{COM}(\vec{r}_p)$ vector field, a scalar-valued function $I^{iCOM}(\vec{r}_p)$ is retrieved. 
%
This function is directly proportional to the sample's phase object $\phi(r)$, which is normally imaged directly in TEM imaging. 
%
The integration is carried out iteratively in the Fourier domain, similar to the method described in~\cite{varnavidesIterativePhaseRetrieval2023}.

Instead of integrating the $\vec{I}^{COM}(\vec{r}_p)$ image to retrieve the phase object, a  differentiation operation can be applied to find the divergence of the phase acquired, which is equal to the divergence of the electric field. This operation yields information on the distribution of charges in the sample plane.

The equations associated with these processes are as follows:

\begin{align}
    \vec{I}^{COM}(\vec{r}_p) &\propto -\sigma\vec{E}_{\perp}(\vec{r}_p) - \mu \vec{B}_{\perp}(\vec{r}_p)\\
    I^{iCOM}(\vec{r}_p) &\propto \sigma \Phi_z(\vec{r}_p)\\
    I^{dCOM}(\vec{r}_p) &\propto -\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}\rho_z(\vec{r}_p) 
\end{align}


\section{Implementation and Validation of COM analysis tools}

In the previous theory section on centre-of-mass (COM) analysis, we highlighted two different scenarios, each necessitating a distinct approach to COM analysis due to varying effects on the diffracted electron beam.
%
Both scenarios require different methods of data analysis because computing the COM of the magnitude of the exit-wave would not effectively separate deviations in COM from the displacement of the diffraction pattern caused by large features and the redistribution of intensity within the bright-field disk resulting from small features.

All values are given as (sub)pixel shifts across the sensor. The axes correspond with those given in the vHAADF image \textbf{e}.}
    \label{fig:hole_dis}
\end{figure}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The separation of both contributions to the COM signal is performed by a newly developed Python program. This program first shifts all individual diffraction patterns for all probe positions and then computes the COM of the aligned bright field disks.
%
Shifting the diffraction patterns is achieved by initially applying a 2D convolution with both Sobel matrices to all diffraction patterns to compute the edges of all disks within a diffraction pattern. These computed edge frames are then averaged over the probe positions to obtain the mean position of all edges in momentum space.
%
Subsequently, each diffraction pattern frame is shifted toward the mean edge position frame using a subpixel shift function in SciPy~\cite{2020SciPy-NMeth}. The subpixel shift value is determined by computing the cross-correlation and fitting either a Gaussian or Lorentzian distribution to find the subpixel centre and its associated error.
%
Finally, the computation of the mean edge frame and the shift towards the mean can be repeated as many times as needed to converge to an exact location and eliminate the shift of the diffraction pattern. In practise, one such iteration proved sufficient, and all subsequent results were obtained with a single iteration.
To benchmark the correction of the CBED shift a scenario such as when the electron probe's cross-sectional area is significantly smaller than the feature under investigation is needed. As seen with the hole in the otherwise uniform moiré bilayer depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:hole_dis}\textbf{e}, this conditions is met, since the hole can be imaged with well-defined edges. 
%
As mentioned in previous studies, changes in sample geometry, such as edges and slopes, can cause the electron beam to deflect.  
%
This deflection tends to occur towards the thicker regions within the sample~\cite{ophusFourDimensionalScanningTransmission2019a,dekkers1974differential}. 
%
By monitoring the periphery of the bright field disk and observing its variation relative to its average position, we can identify the deflection of the BF disk in both the $x$- and $y$-directions. 
%
This deflection in the $x$ and $y$ direction is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hole_dis}\textbf{a,b}, while the combined deflection magnitude and angle are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:hole_dis}\textbf{c,d}, respectively
%
The observed phenomena are consistent with expectations, as the electron beam displacements move toward the material. 
%
Interestingly, several probe points at the center of the hole exhibit minimal displacement, indicating that the beam's cross-sectional area is indeed smaller than the hole itself.

    \label{fig:hole_mom}
\end{figure}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the data on CBED pattern displacement, we can also calculate the momentum transfer imparted to the electron beam, employing methods similar to those described in~\cite{mullerAtomicElectricFields2014}. 
%
The net momentum transfer and its direction are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:hole_mom}, accompanied by a virtual high-angle annular dark field image for context. 
%
The plot reveals higher momentum transfer at probe positions nearer to the hole's edge, which diminishes as the probe moves further across the sample or closer to the hole's centre.

\section{Analysis of momentum transfer in twisted \ce{WSe_2} moiré superlattice}
%
This sample of stamped \ce{WSe_2} was created using the mechanical transfer method described earlier. Upon inspection in STEM mode, the large features highlighted with the green outline in Figure~\ref{fig:dub_moire}\textbf{a} appeared as a result of three separate layers of material slightly out of alignment with each other. 
%
The resulting moiré unit cell is outlined with dashed lines in Figure~\ref{fig:dub_moire}\textbf{b} and is measured to be caused by a \SI{2.3}{\degree} rotation between the crystal lattice of the this strip (highlighted in green) and the moiré pattern present in the underlying layers (highlighted in blue).

%Missing a justification what we are looking at "electric field measurements?"
In the following sections, I will examine two distinct moiré regions from our previously discussed sample: one characterised by a moiré periodic lattice formed by a sub \SI{1}{\degree} misalignment, and another characterised by double misalignment, caused by another layer twisted by about \SI{2.3}{\degree} on top a region otherwise similar to the previous case.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \caption{\textbf{a}) High-angle annular dark field photograph, image shows material increasing in layer number from the bottom left to the top right.

    \label{fig:dub_moire}
\end{figure}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, let's look at the larger moiré cell characterised by the sub-\SI{1}{\degree} stacking angle between layers. The data for the moiré lattice were collected from the region highlighted in blue in Figure~\ref{fig:dub_moire}.
Second, we will compare the smaller moiré cell characterised by a double stacking angle mismatch (highlighted in green in Fig.~\ref{fig:dub_moire}\textbf{a}) to the previously mentioned region.
%
Similar to the hole dataset, we calculated the shift in the bright field disk for probe positions using the edge-detect method and subpixel shift correction as described previously, for one iteration.

The results of the diffraction pattern shifts for the green highlighted area are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:appendix_cbed_trip_moire} in Appendix A. 
%
From the virtual-HAADF image derived from these datasets, we determined that the probe's cross-sectional area is approximately half the size of a moiré unit cell. 
%
Since were are interested in features within the moiré unit cell, the diffraction pattern shift was corrected, and further corrections to the dataset were made by subtracting the bright field disk of the shift-corrected probe position-averaged diffraction pattern from every diffraction pattern to approximately remove the constant contributions of the uncorrected probe.
%
The BF disk COM analyses were carried out after all corrections and are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:m_dis}~and~\ref{fig:trip_m_dis} in Appendix A for the larger (highlighted in blue) and smaller (highlighted in green) moiré lattices.
%
In the COM analysis of the intensity redistribution for the larger moiré lattice, a clear distinction between the unit cell's interior and its walls is observed, as they appear to displace the electron beam diffraction pattern opposing directions.
%
In contrast, the smaller moiré lattice's unit cell walls appear to have no effect on the COM.

    \label{fig:trip_m_mom}
\end{figure}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To investigate further, the momentum imparted on the electron probe was calculated from the COM measurements.
%
The magnitude and direction of momentum transferred into the electron probe by features within the moiré cell are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:trip_m_mom}. In this figure, the reconstructed virtual-HAADF photographs are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:trip_m_mom}\textbf{a,c} for the large and small moiré lattice. Fig~\ref{fig:trip_m_mom}\textbf{b,d} show the magnitude and direction of momentum transfer. Please note the different scale for the colour bar. The plots for the larger moiré lattice display two moiré unit cell outlines, while the plots for the smaller moiré lattice display one moiré unit cell.



One can discern a noticeably periodicity in both momentum measurements (Fig.~\ref{fig:trip_m_mom}~\textbf{b,d}) that aligns with the nuances in their respective virtual-HAADF images (Fig.~\ref{fig:trip_m_mom}~\textbf{a,c}), and there is a consistency in values across moiré unit cells. 
%
For the larger moiré lattice, the contrast between moiré cell center and its border in the COM is also reflected in the momentum transfer, with the center of the moiré cell imparting momentum in the opposite direction as the cell border. The magnitude of momentum transfer within the moiré cell appears to be approximately twice that at the border.
%
Overall the momentum transfer of the larger moiré cell (Fig.~\ref{fig:trip_m_mom}\textbf{b}) also appears to be nearly curl-free, indicating that the most significant effect within the moiré unit cell affecting the electron probe is an electric potential gradient.
%
In contrast, the momentum transfer of the smaller moiré lattice into the electron probe (Fig.~\ref{fig:trip_m_mom}\textbf{d}) is primarily comprised of a curl component.

Here, a clear distinction can be observed between the high-symmetry points, which manifest as white blobs in the virtual-HAADF image (see Figure~\ref{fig:trip_m_mom}\textbf{c}), and the thin semi-disordered regions that connect them.
%
To enhance clarity, the moiré unit cell's outline has been sketched (Fig.~\ref{fig:trip_m_mom}\textbf{c,d}), encircling two high symmetry points, with a third at the vertex. 
%
Interestingly, the two enclosed vortices have a greater magnitude than the vertex vortex, even if their intensity in the virtual-HAADF image doesn't reflect this. 
%
Since the momentum transfer only shows these vortices, it is likely caused by an in-sample-plane magnetic field.
%
Similar effects have been predicted in homobilayer  structures using density functional theory~\cite{wuTopologicalInsulatorsTwisted2019} as well as \ce{MoTe_2}/~\ce{WSe_2} heterostructures~\cite{zhangSpintexturedChernBands2021}.
%
This observation in our current \ce{WSe_2} structure remains not fully understood at present and calls for deeper analysis and theoretical calculations.
