Two-dimensional layered materials have garnered significant attention as they exhibit exciting optical, thermal and electronic properties that change dramatically as the material is thinned down from bulk to monolayer. The already vast amount of tunability increases even further as one starts to stack these thin two-dimensional building blocks into larger potentially twisted heterostructures. Van der Waals forces that normally hold together the layers in the bulk crystal also form the glue that holds these new heterostructures together. This relative ease in manufacturing as well as the potential applications in fields ranging from power electronics and solar cells to single photon emitters and biosensors makes studying these materials more than worthwhile~\cite{LI2016322, https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202107059}.\\
Studying these fascinating materials and the dynamical interplay between the tunable physical properties such as strain, twist angle and material combination calls for highly sophisticated and specialised characterisation techniques. Therefore Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy will be used in combination with a state-of-the-art, fast and high dynamic range direct electron detector to gather highly localised information. The innovative electron microscope pixelated array detector will be used to capture the diffraction information of a small area in the heterostructure crystal lattice by scanning over the sample with small localised electron probe in a rasterised pattern to form a four-dimensional dataset. From these four-dimensional datasets accurate strain-, electrical- and potential-fields can be mapped with  micrometre and nanometre precision respectively. To this end a new to us centre-of-mass analysis approach will be developed and implemented in an existing dataset exploration framework used for rapid experimentation of electron microscope parameters at the time of acquisition.\\
In the report relevant theory on electron microscopy and crystallography will be presented first in Section \ref{sec:theory} after which the fabrication of moir√© heterostructures will be explained in Section \ref{sec:methods}. The EMPAD and the datasets it captures and how it will be analysed is explained in Section \ref{sec:empad}. The results stemming from the application of the new analysis techniques are explained in Section \ref{sec:results}, and finally, the conclusions and the future possibilities will be touched upon in Section \ref{sec:outlook}.
