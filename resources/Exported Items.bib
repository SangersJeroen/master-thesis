  abstract = {Abstract                            Defects in materials give rise to fluctuations in electrostatic fields that reflect the local charge density, but imaging this with single atom sensitivity is challenging. However, if possible, this provides information about the energetics of adatom binding, localized conduction channels, molecular functionality and their relationship to individual bonds. Here, ultrastable electron-optics are combined with a high-speed 2D electron detector to map electrostatic fields around individual atoms in 2D monolayers using 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy. Simultaneous imaging of the electric field, phase, annular dark field and the total charge in 2D MoS               2               and WS               2               is demonstrated for pristine areas and regions with 1D wires. The in-gap states in sulphur line vacancies cause 1D electron-rich channels that are mapped experimentally and confirmed using density functional theory calculations. We show how electrostatic fields are sensitive in defective areas to changes of atomic bonding and structural determination beyond conventional imaging.},

  abstract = {Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) excels in accessing atomic-scale structure and chemistry. Enhancing our ability to directly image the functionalities of local features in materials has become one of the most important topics in the future development of STEM. Recently, differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging has been utilized to map the internal electric and magnetic fields in materials from nanoscale features such as p\textendash n junctions, skyrmions, and even from individual atoms. Here, we use an ultra-low noise SCMOS detector in as the diffraction plane camera to collect four-dimensional (4D) datasets. The high angular resolution, efficient high-SNR acquisition, and modifiability of the camera allow it to function as a universal detector, where STEM imaging configurations, such as DPC, bright field, annular bright field, and annular dark field can all be reconstructed from a single 4D dataset. By examining a distorted perovskite, \-DyScO3, which possesses projected lattice spacings as small as 0.83 \AA, we demonstrate DPC spatial resolution almost reaching the information limit of a 100 keV electron beam. In addition, the perovskite has ordered O-coordinations with alternating octahedral tilts, which can be quantitatively measured with single degree accuracy by taking advantage of DPC's sensitivity to light atoms. The results, acquired on a standard Ronchigram camera as opposed to a specialized DPC detector, open up new opportunities to understand and design functional materials and devices that involve lattice and charge coupling at nano- and atomic-scales.},

  abstract = {Four-dimensional (4D) scanning transmission electron microscopy is used to study the electric fields at the edges of 2D semiconducting monolayer MoS2. Sub-nanometer 1D features in the 2D electric field maps are observed at the outermost region along zigzag edges and also along nanowire MoS-terminated MoS2 edges. Atomic-scale oscillations are detected in the magnitude of the 1D electromagnetic edge state, with spatial variations that depend on the specific periodic edge reconstructions. Electric field reconstructions, along with integrated differential phase contrast reconstructions, reveal the presence of low Z number atoms terminating many of the uniform edges, which are difficult to detect by annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy due to its limited dynamic range. Density functional theory calculations support the formation of periodic 1D edge states and also show that enhancement of the electric field magnitude can occur for some edge terminations. The experimentally observed electric fields at the edges are attributed to the absence of an opposing electric field from a nearest neighbor atom when the electron beam propagates through the 2D monolayer and interacts. These results show the potential of 4D-STEM to map the atomic scale structure and fluctuations of electric fields around edge atoms with different bonding states than bulk atoms in 2D materials, beyond conventional imaging.},
