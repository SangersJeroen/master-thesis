    abstract = {Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is an analytical
                technique that measures the change in kinetic energy of electrons
                after they have interacted with a specimen. When carried out in a
                modern transmission electron microscope, EELS is capable of
                giving structural and chemical information about a solid, with a
                spatial resolution down to the atomic level in favourable cases.
                The energy resolution is typically 1 eV but can approach 0.1 eV
                if an electron-beam monochromator is used. This review provides
                an overview of EELS instrumentation and of the physics involved
                in the scattering of kilovolt electrons in solids. Features of
                the energy-loss spectrum are discussed, including plasmon peaks,
                inner-shell ionization edges and fine structure related to the
                electronic densities of states. Examples are given of the use of
                EELS for the measurement of local properties, including specimen
                thickness, mechanical and electronic properties (such as bandgap)
                and chemical composition. Factors that determine the spatial
                resolution of the analysis are outlined, including radiation
                damage to the specimen. Comparisons are made with related
                techniques, particularly x-ray absorption spectroscopy.},

                spectroscopy and electron spectroscopic imaging in transmission
                electron microscopy have a long history. The first commercial
                post-column imaging energy filter became available already in the
                early 1990s. Since then this technique has become an important
                tool for analytic electron microscopy. Nevertheless, the imaging
                performance of post-column energy-filters is undoubtedly inferior
                compared to in-column energy filters and their principal design
                is clearly restricted by practical constraints we found that
                significant improvements with respect to optical performance and
                alignment flexibility are still possible compared to the
                presently available instrumentation. By applying calculation
                methods originally developed for the design of aberration
                correctors and spending much care on the precise design of the
                optical elements and the alignment strategies we could develop a
                new post-column imaging energy filter with a minimalistic and
                robust optical design but remarkable optical properties. Compared
                to other state-of-the-art devices in our design the aberrations
                determining the energy resolution are reduced by one order of
                magnitude for the same entrance aperture. Therefore, if desirable
                , the field of view can be enlarged by more than a factor of two
                in area while the optical aberrations stay comparable or even
                better. We describe the principal optical design of the CEOS
                Energy-Filtering and Imaging Device (CEFID), explain methods for
                aberration measurement and optical characterization, and finally
                demonstrate its optical performance by measured imaging and
                spectroscopy data from two prototype systems.},

                spectroscopy (EELS) requires reliable access to the low-loss
                region where the zero-loss peak (ZLP) often overwhelms the
                contributions associated to inelastic scatterings off the
                specimen. Here we deploy machine learning techniques developed in
                particle physics to realise a model-independent, multidimensional
                determination of the ZLP with a faithful uncertainty estimate.
                This novel method is then applied to subtract the ZLP for EEL
                spectra acquired in flower-like WS2 nanostructures characterised
                by a 2H/3R mixed polytypism. From the resulting subtracted
                spectra we determine the nature and value of the bandgap of
                polytypic WS2, finding EBG=1.6−0.2+0.3eV with a clear preference
                for an indirect bandgap. Further, we demonstrate how this method
                enables us to robustly identify excitonic transitions down to
                very small energy losses. Our approach has been implemented and
                made available in an open source Python package dubbed

                stability and the structural and electronic properties of the
                indium selenide (InSe) monolayers with the adsorbed small
                molecules, including CO, H2O, NH3, N2, NO2, NO, and O2. It is
                found that all the molecules are physisorbed on the InSe
                monolayer surface and act as electron acceptors for the InSe,
                except NH3 which is found to be an electron donor. Furthermore,
                for most of the molecules studied, the adsorption cannot induce
                obvious changes in the band structures near the Fermi level
                compared with those of the pristine InSe monolayer. However, it
                is noted that the adsorbed InSe monolayers have new in-gap states
                induced by the open-shell molecules (NO2, NO, and O2), which may
                trigger some new effects on the optical properties of the
                materials. Our theoretical findings suggest that two-dimensional
                InSe nanomaterials hold great promise for fabricating gas sensors
                based on a physisorption-based charge transfer mechanism.},

    abstract = {Energy filtering transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) is a
                widely used technique in many areas of scientific research. Image
                contrast in energy-filtered images arises from specific
                scattering events such as the ionization of atoms. By combining a
                set of two or more images, relative sample thickness maps or
                elemental distribution maps can be easily created. It is also
                possible to acquire a whole series of energy-filtered images to
                do more complex data analysis. However, whenever several images
                are combined to extract certain information, problems are
                introduced due to sample drift between the exposures. In order to
                obtain artifact-free information, this spatial drift has to be
                taken care of. Manual alignment by overlaying and shifting the
                images to find the best overlap is usually very accurate but
                extremely time consuming for larger data sets. When large amounts
                of images are recorded in an EFTEM series, manual correction is
                no longer a reasonable option. Hence, automatic routines have
                been developed that are mostly based on the cross-correlation
                algorithm. Existing routines, however, sometimes fail and again
                make time consuming manual adjustments necessary. In this paper
                we describe a new approach to the drift correction problem by
                incorporating a statistical treatment of the data and we present
                our statistically determined spatial drift (SDSD) correction
                program. We show its improved performance by applying it to a
                typical EFTEM series data block.},

    abstract = "Tungsten is the heaviest transition metal in the family of
                common transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Despite the
                essential similarities of TMDCs{,} the considerable differences
                in the size and charge of the building elements can make the
                typical 2D layered structure suitable for various applications.
                There is not much flexibility on the chalcogen side{,} as the
                popular elements are S and Se. Following the successful history
                of transition metal sulphides in various applications{,}
                transition metal selenides are now the rising stars. On the
                transition metal side{,} WS2 and WSe2 have recently attracted
                considerable attention. In comparison with the Mo counterparts{,}
                W is more abundant in the Earth{'}s crust and thus cheaper{,} and
                less toxic. The significantly larger size of W atoms can
                substantially tune the TMDC properties. The popularity of
                molybdenum dichalcogenides has somehow overshadowed the
                potentials of tungsten dichalcogenides. This manuscript attempts
                to collect the recent reports on various applications of WS2 and
                WSe2 to provide a general overview of tungsten dichalcogenides.
                Due to the popularity of sulphides{,} the prime focus of the
                present review is on WSe2{,} which is an emerging member of this
                family. Although WTe2 is not a common material like all
                transition metal tellurides{,} it is also briefly reviewed as a
                member of this sub-family of TMDCs owing to its unique properties
                {,} which named it as a potential candidate for giant
                magnetoresistance and superconductivity.",
