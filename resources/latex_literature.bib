Live processing allows to reconstruct and display the specimen transmission function gradually while diffraction patterns are acquired. For this purpose, we reformulate WDD and apply a dimensionality reduction technique that reduces memory consumption and increases processing speed. We show numerically that this approach maintains the reconstruction quality of specimen transfer functions as well as reduces computational complexity during acquisition processes. Although we only present the reconstruction for scanning transmission electron microscopy datasets, in general, the live processing algorithm we present in this paper can be applied to real-time ptychographic reconstruction for different fields of application.},

We find that the in-plane stiffness of monolayer MoS2 is 180 ( 60 Nm\`A1, corresponding to an effective Young's modulus of 270 ( 100 GPa, which is comparable to that of steel. Breaking occurs at an effective strain between 6 and 11\% with the average breaking strength of 15 ( 3 Nm\`A1 (23 GPa). The strength of strongest monolayer membranes is 11\% of its Young's modulus, corresponding to the upper theoretical limit which indicates that the material can be highly crystalline and almost defect-free.

The breaking of out-of-plane symmetry, along with the spin\textendash orbit coupling, induces Rashba spin-splitting (RSS) in these materials. In this work, RSS in Janus tin dichalcogenide monolayers are studied. In addition, the heterostructures (HSs) of Janus SnXY and WXY (X, Y = S, Se, Te; X {$\not$}= Y) monolayers are discussed. A RSS energy of about 43 meV, more significant than the room temperature energy, is observed in the Janus SnSSe/WSSe HS. The consequences of vertical strain on the semiconducting HS are examined. Compressive vertical strain enhances and tensile strain reduces, the spin-splitting. For the compressive strain of 10.4\%, Janus SnSSe/WSSe HS remains semiconductor with only Rashba bands surrounding near the Fermi level. Enhanced Rashba parameter of about 0.96 eV \AA{} and splitting energy of about 72 meV are observed. These findings confirm that Janus SnSSe/WSSe HS is a productive Rashba material for spintronic device applications.},

This family of materials allows for the realization of versatile electronic devices and holds promise for next-generation (opto)electronics. Their electronic properties strongly depend on the number of layers, making them interesting from a fundamental standpoint. For electronic applications, semiconducting 2D materials benefit from sizable mobilities and large on/off ratios, due to the large modulation achievable via the gate field-effect. Moreover, being mechanically strong and flexible, these materials can withstand large strain ({$>$}10\%) before rupture, making them interesting for strain engineering and flexible devices. Even in their single layer form, semiconducting 2D materials have demonstrated efficient light absorption, enabling large responsivity in photodetectors. Therefore, semiconducting layered 2D materials are strong candidates for optoelectronic applications, especially for photodetection. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in photodetectors based on semiconducting 2D materials, focusing on the transition metal dichalcogenides, novel van der Waals materials, black phosphorus, and heterostructures. \textcopyright{} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.},

  abstract = {What does the diffraction pattern from a single atom look like? How does it differ from the scattering from long-range potential? With the development of new high-dynamic range pixel array detectors to measure the complete momentum distribution, these questions have immediate relevance for designing and understanding momentumresolved imaging modes. We explore the asymptotic limits of long-range and shortrange potentials. We use a simple quantum mechanical model to explain the general and asymptotic limits for the probability distribution in both real and reciprocal space. Features in the scattering potential much larger than the probe size cause the bright field (BF) disk to deflect uniformly, while features much smaller than the probe size, instead of a deflection, cause a redistribution of intensity within the BF disk. Because long-range and short-range features are encoded differently in the diffraction pattern, it is possible to separate their contributions in differential phase\textendash contrast (DPC) or center-of-mass (CoM) imaging. The shape profiles for atomic resolution CoM imaging are dominated by the shape of the probe gradient and not the highly singular atomic potentials or their local fields. Instead, only the peak height shows an atomic number sensitivity, whose precise dependence is determined by the convergence angle. At lower convergence angles, the contrast oscillates with increasing atomic number, similar to BF imaging. The range of collection angles impacts DPC and CoM imaging differently, with CoM being more sensitive to the upper cutoff limit, while DPC is more sensitive to the lower cutoff.},

This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity\textemdash which cannot be explained by weak electron\textendash phonon interactions\textemdash in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1\textdegree\textemdash the first `magic' angle\textemdash the electronic band structure of this `twisted bilayer graphene' exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature\textendash carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

To date, deterministic transfer methods rely on the use of sacrificial polymer layers and wet chemistry to some extent.

This is found to be very advantageous to freely suspend these materials as there are no capillary forces involved in the process.

In this study, momentum-resolved four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) is proposed for the quantification of these potentials and the optimization steps required to reach quantitative agreement with simulations for the GaAs/AlAs hetero-junction model system are shown. Using STEM the differences in the mean inner potentials ({$\increment$}MIP) of two materials forming an interface and resulting dynamic diffraction effects have to be considered. This study shows that the measurement quality is significantly improved by precession, energy filtering and a off-zone-axis alignment of the specimen. Complementary simulations yielding a {$\increment$}MIP of 1.3~V confirm that the potential drop due to charge transfer at the intrinsic interface is {$\approx$}0.1~V, in agreement with experimental and theoretical values found in literture.

Electrical measurements of the vertically staked WSe2/MoS2 heterojunctions reveal excellent current rectification behavior with an ideality factor of 1.2. Photocurrent mapping shows rapid photoresponse over the entire overlapping region with a highest external quantum efficiency up to 12\%.

  abstract = {We predict that twisted bilayers of 1T-ZrS2 realize a novel and tunable platform to engineer two-dimensional topological quantum phases dominated by strong spin-orbit interactions. At small twist angles, ZrS2 heterostructures give rise to an emergent and twist-controlled moir\'e Kagome lattice, combining geometric frustration and strong spin-orbit coupling to give rise to a moir\'e quantum spin Hall insulator with highly controllable and nearly-dispersionless bands. We devise a generic pseudo-spin theory for group-IV transition metal dichalcogenides that relies on the two-component character of the valence band maximum of the 1T structure at {$\Gamma$}, and study the emergence of a robust quantum anomalous Hall phase as well as possible fractional Chern insulating states from strong Coulomb repulsion at fractional fillings of the topological moir\'e Kagome bands. Our results establish group-IV transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers as a novel moir\'e platform to realize strongly-correlated topological phases in a twist-tunable setting.},

  abstract = {Defects in crystalline lattices cause modulation of the atomic density, and this leads to variations in the associated electrostatics at the nanoscale. Mapping these spatially varying charge fluctuations using transmission electron microscopy has typically been challenging due to complicated contrast transfer inherent to conventional phase contrast imaging. To overcome this, we used four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to measure electrostatic fields near point dislocations in a monolayer. The asymmetry of the atomic density in a (1,0) edge dislocation core in graphene yields a local enhancement of the electric field in part of the dislocation core. Through experiment and simulation, the increased electric field magnitude is shown to arise from ``long-range'' interactions from beyond the nearest atomic neighbor. These results provide insights into the use of 4D-STEM to quantify electrostatics in thin materials and map out the lateral potential variations that are important for molecular and atomic bonding through Coulombic interactions.},

The maps are calculated and displayed in real time, along with conventional annular dark-field images, through the use of customdeveloped hardware and software. An increased electric field is observed around boron monovacancies and subsequently mapped and measured relative to the perfect lattice. The edges of extended defects feature enhanced electric fields, which can be used to trap diffusing adatoms. The magnitude of the electric field produced by the different types of edges is compared to monolayer areas, confirming previous predictions regarding their stability.

  abstract = {Graphene devices on standard SiO2 substrates are highly disordered, exhibiting characteristics that are far inferior to the expected intrinsic properties of graphene1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Although suspending the graphene above the substrate leads to a substantial improvement in device quality13,14, this geometry imposes severe limitations on device architecture and functionality. There is a growing need, therefore, to identify dielectrics that allow a substrate-supported geometry while retaining the quality achieved with a suspended sample. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an appealing substrate, because it has an atomically smooth surface that is relatively free of dangling bonds and charge traps. It also has a lattice constant similar to that of graphite, and has large optical phonon modes and a large electrical bandgap. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of high-quality exfoliated mono- and bilayer graphene devices on single-crystal h-BN substrates, by using a mechanical transfer process. Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO2. These devices also show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity. The ability to assemble crystalline layered materials in a controlled way permits the fabrication of graphene devices on other promising dielectrics15 and allows for the realization of more complex graphene heterostructures.},

In its bulk form, black phosphorus shows high carrier mobility ({$\sim$}10\,000 cm2/V{$\cdot$}s) and a {$\sim$}0.3 eV direct band gap. Well-behaved p-type field-effect transistors with mobilities of up to 1000 cm2/V{$\cdot$}s, as well as phototransistors, have been demonstrated on few-layer black phosphorus, showing its promise for electronics and optoelectronics applications due to its high hole mobility and thickness-dependent direct band gap.

In this paper, we demonstrate a gate-tunable p\textendash n diode based on a p-type black phosphorus/n-type monolayer MoS2 van der Waals p\textendash n heterojunction. Upon illumination, these ultrathin p\textendash n diodes show a maximum photodetection responsivity of 418 mA/W at the wavelength of 633 nm and photovoltaic energy conversion with an external quantum efficiency of 0.3\%.

Exploring the full potential of these layered materials requires precise spatial modulation of their chemical composition and electronic properties to create well-defined heterostructures. Here, we report the growth of compositionally modulated MoS2\textendash MoSe2 and WS2\textendash WSe2 lateral heterostructures by in situ modulation of the vapour-phase reactants during growth of these two-dimensional crystals. Raman and photoluminescence mapping studies demonstrate that the resulting heterostructure nanosheets exhibit clear structural and optical modulation. Transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping studies reveal a single crystalline structure with opposite modulation of sulphur and selenium distributions across the heterostructure interface. Electrical transport studies demonstrate that the WSe2\textendash WS2 heterojunctions form lateral p\textendash n diodes and photodiodes, and can be used to create complementary inverters with high voltage gain. Our study is an important advance in the development of layered semiconductor heterostructures, an essential step towards achieving functional electronics and optoelectronics.},

At large enough moir\textbackslash 'e lengths, all moir\textbackslash 'e systems relax into commensurated 2D domains separated by networks of dislocation lines. The nodes of the 2D dislocation line network can be considered as vortex-like topological defects. We find that a simple analogy to common topological systems with an \$S\^1\$ order parameter, such as a superconductor or planar ferromagnet, cannot correctly capture the topological nature of these defects. For example, in twisted bilayer graphene, the order parameter space for the relaxed moir\textbackslash 'e system is homotopy equivalent to a punctured torus. Here, the nodes of the 2D dislocation network can be characterized as elements of the fundamental group of the punctured torus, the free group on two generators, endowing these network nodes with non-Abelian properties. Extending this analysis to consider moir\textbackslash 'e patterns generated from any relative strain, we find that antivortices occur in the presence of anisotropic heterostrain, such as shear or anisotropic expansion, while arrays of vortices appear under twist or isotropic expansion between vdW materials. Experimentally, utilizing the dark field imaging capability of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we demonstrate the existence of vortex and antivortex pair formation in a moir\textbackslash 'e system, caused by competition between different types of heterostrains in the vdW interfaces. We also present a methodology for mapping the underlying heterostrain of a moir\textbackslash 'e structure from experimental TEM data, which provides a quantitative relation between the various components of heterostrain and vortex-antivortex density in moir\textbackslash 'e systems.},

The disappearance of acid or alkali from the mucosal solution of short-circuited tissue was measured with a pH stat while the serosal pH was kept at 7.4. The duodenum rapidly disposed of both acid and alkali; neither property was altered by gassing with N2 while iodoacetate was in the perfusing solutions. Prevention of release of CO2 from the mucosal chamber obliterated the early rapid phase of acid disposal by the mucosa while a similar maneuver in the serosal chamber increased the appearance of serosal acid without altering the rate of acid disposal. Gut sacs of rabbit duodenum in vitro and in vivo showed a positive correlation between acid disposal and the rate of luminal CO2 production. While acid disposal progressively decreased with time for the in vitro gut sacs, the in vivo gut sac showed no fatigue in this respect. Luminal acidification in the Ussing chamber was associated with a profound reduction in short-circuit current (Isc), partially reversible by elevation of the mucosal pH but not by luminal glucose. Our data suggest that acid disposal occurs in part by intraluminal neutralization and in part by diffusion into the mucosa.},

  abstract = {Designer heterostructures can be assembled layer-by-layer with unmatched precision thanks to the recently developed deterministic placement methods to transfer two-dimensional materials.           ,              Designer heterostructures can now be assembled layer-by-layer with unmatched precision thanks to the recently developed deterministic placement methods to transfer two-dimensional (2D) materials. This possibility constitutes the birth of a very active research field on the so-called van der Waals heterostructures. Moreover, these deterministic placement methods also open the door to fabricate complex devices, which would be otherwise very difficult to achieve by conventional bottom-up nanofabrication approaches, and to fabricate fully-encapsulated devices with exquisite electronic properties. The integration of 2D materials with existing technologies such as photonic and superconducting waveguides and fiber optics is another exciting possibility. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of the deterministic placement methods, describing and comparing the different alternative methods available in the literature, and we illustrate their potential to fabricate van der Waals heterostructures, to integrate 2D materials into complex devices and to fabricate artificial bilayer structures where the layers present a user-defined rotational twisting angle.},

An important milestone was the creation of heterostructures based on graphene and other two-dimensional crystals, which can be assembled into three-dimensional stacks with atomic layer precision5,6,7. Such layered structures have already demonstrated a range of fascinating physical phenomena8,9,10,11, and have also been used in demonstrating a prototype field-effect tunnelling transistor12, which is regarded to be a candidate for post-CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) technology. The range of possible materials that could be incorporated into such stacks is very large. Indeed, there are many other materials with layers linked by weak van der Waals forces that can be exfoliated3,13 and combined together to create novel highly tailored heterostructures. Here, we describe a new generation of field-effect vertical tunnelling transistors where two-dimensional tungsten disulphide serves as an atomically thin barrier between two layers of either mechanically exfoliated or chemical vapour deposition-grown graphene. The combination of tunnelling (under the barrier) and thermionic (over the barrier) transport allows for unprecedented current modulation exceeding 1~\texttimes ~106 at room temperature and very high ON current. These devices can also operate on transparent and flexible substrates.},

  abstract = {Heterostructures comprising van der Waals (vdW) stacked transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers are a fascinating class of two-dimensional (2D) materials. The presence of interlayer excitons, where the electron and the hole remain spatially separated in the two layers due to ultrafast charge transfer, is an intriguing feature of these heterostructures. The optoelectronic functionality of 2D heterostructure devices is critically dependent on the relative rotation angle of the layers. However, the role of the relative rotation angle of the constituent layers on intralayer absorption is not clear yet. Here, we investigate MoS2/WSe2 vdW heterostructures using monochromated low-loss electron energy loss (EEL) spectroscopy combined with aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and report that momentum conservation is a critical factor in the intralayer absorption of TMDC vdW heterostructures. The evolution of the intralayer excitonic low-loss EEL spectroscopy peak broadenings as a function of the rotation angle reveals that the interlayer charge transfer rate can be about an order of magnitude faster in the aligned (or anti-aligned) case than in the misaligned cases. These results provide a deeper insight into the role of momentum conservation, one of the fundamental principles governing charge transfer dynamics in 2D vdW heterostructures.},

  abstract = {Two dimensional (2D) materials have attracted great attention due to their unique properties and atomic thickness. Although various 2D materials have been successfully synthesized with different optical and electrical properties, a strategy for fabricating 2D heterostructures must be developed in order to construct more complicated devices for practical applications. Here we demonstrate for the first time a two-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method for growing transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures, where MoSe2 was synthesized first and followed by an epitaxial growth of WSe2 on the edge and on the top surface of MoSe2. Compared to previously reported one-step growth methods, this two-step growth has the capability of spatial and size control of each 2D component, leading to much larger (up to 169 {$\mu$}m) heterostructure size, and cross-contamination can be effectively minimized. Furthermore, this two-step growth produces well-defined 2H and 3R stacking in the WSe2/MoSe2 bilayer regions and much sharper in-plane interfaces than the previously reported MoSe2/WSe2 heterojunctions obtained from one-step growth methods. The resultant heterostructures with WSe2/MoSe2 bilayer and the exposed MoSe2 monolayer display rectification characteristics of a p\textendash n junction, as revealed by optoelectronic tests, and an internal quantum efficiency of 91\% when functioning as a photodetector. A photovoltaic effect without any external gates was observed, showing incident photon to converted electron (IPCE) efficiencies of approximately 0.12\%, providing application potential in electronics and energy harvesting.},

Here, we report a one-step growth strategy for the creation of high-quality vertically stacked as well as in-plane interconnected heterostructures of WS2/MoS2 via control of the growth temperature. Vertically stacked bilayers with WS2 epitaxially grown on top of the MoS2 monolayer are formed with preferred stacking order at high temperature. A~strong interlayer excitonic transition is observed due to the type II band alignment and to the clean interface of these bilayers. Vapour growth at low temperature, on the other hand, leads to lateral epitaxy of WS2 on MoS2 edges, creating seamless and atomically sharp in-plane heterostructures that generate strong localized photoluminescence enhancement and intrinsic p\textendash n junctions. The fabrication of heterostructures from monolayers, using simple and scalable growth, paves the way for the creation of unprecedented two-dimensional materials with exciting properties.},

  abstract = {The electron-hole separation efficiency is a key factor that determines the performance of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and devices. Therefore, searching for novel 2D TMD materials with long timescale of carrier lifetime becomes one of the most important topics. Here, based on the timedomain density functional theory (TD-DFT), we propose a brand new TMD material, namely janus-MoSTe, which exhibits a strong build-in electric field. Our results show that in janus-MoSTe monolayer, the exciton consisting of electron and hole has a relatively wide spatial extension and low binding energy. In addition, a slow electron-hole recombination process is observed, with timescale on the order of 1.31 ns, which is even comparable with those of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. Further analysis reveals that the extremely long timescale for electron-hole recombination could be ascribed to the strong Coulomb screening effect as well as the small overlap of wavefunctions between electrons and holes. Our findings establish the build-in electric field as an effective factor to control the electron-hole recombination dynamics in TMD monolayers and facilitate their future applications in light detecting and harvesting.},

Here we present an alternative polymer-assisted and mechanicalexfoliation-based sample preparation method and demonstrate it on selected oxidation-sensitive transition metal phosphorus trisulfides and transition metal dichalcogenides. The analysis, obtained from the samples prepared with both of the methods clearly show that oxidation is the origin of discrepancy, the oxidation during the final preparation step is strongly reduced only when the new method is applied, and atomically-resolved structural characterization of the pristine structures is now possible.},

  abstract = {We developed a contact inking technique for microcontact printing aiming at the fabrication of conductive silver-nanoparticle (Ag NP) lines with rectangular cross section and constant layer thickness, irrespective of pattern size and shape. In the proposed process, Ag NP ink was first coated on a blanket and then inking was carried out by a contact with a microcontact stamp. The ink transferred atop of the stamp was finally settled on a workpiece by pressing to complete the printing process. To achieve robust inking to the stamp, the peel strengths between the Ag NP layer and the blankets and between the Ag NP layer and the stamp were investigated using poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) materials with different surface energies. Interestingly, it was revealed that the transferability of Ag NP from the blanket toward the stamp was not solely determined by the surface energy difference but also by the extent of solvent uptake by the PDMS blanket during inking. The solvent-containing PDMS significantly lowered its adhesion strength against adjacent ink layers and, as a consequence, the ink transfer was successfully achieved even in case the ink passed from a higher to a lower energy surface. Furthermore, by the solvent-vapour annealing of contact-inked semi-dried patterns, arbitrarily iterated transfers between PDMS surfaces became possible. With the contact-inking process developed here, we demonstrate a finely defined printed structure of Ag NP conductive lines with width of up to 1 {$\mu$}m.},

The required understanding of the intricate relationship between nanoscale crystal structure and the properties of the resulting plasmonic resonances remains, however, elusive for these materials. Specifically, edge- and surface-induced plasmonic resonances, and other collective excitations, are often buried beneath the continuum of electronic transitions, making it difficult to isolate and interpret these signals using techniques such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Here we focus on the experimentally clean energy-gain EELS region to characterise collective excitations in the topologically insulating material Bi2Te3 and correlate them with the underlying crystalline structure with nanoscale resolution. We identify with high significance the presence of a distinct energy-gain peak around -0.8 eV, with spatially-resolved maps revealing that its intensity is markedly enhanced at the edge regions of the specimen. Our findings illustrate the reach of energy-gain EELS analyses to accurately map collective excitations in quantum materials, a key asset in the quest towards new tunable plasmonic devices.},

Electron diffraction patterns of TBG acquired at typical TEM electron energies of 80\textendash 300 keV exhibit the diffraction peaks caused by diffraction on individual layers. However, diffraction peaks at the scattering angles related to the periodicity of the moir\'e structure have not been observed in such diffraction patterns. We show that diffraction on moir\'e structure can create intense diffraction peaks if the energy of the probing electrons is very low, in the range of a few tens of eV. Experimental diffraction patterns of TBG acquired with low-energy electrons of 236 eV exhibiting peaks attributed to the moir\'e structure periodicity are shown. In holography mode, the intensity of the wave transmitted through the sample and measured in the far-field can be enhanced or decreased depending on the atomic arrangement, as for example AA or AB stacking. Thus, a decrease of intensity in the far-field must not necessarily be associated with some absorption inside the sample but can simply be a result of a particular atomic arrangement. We believe that our findings can be important for exploiting graphene as a support in electron imaging.},

We re-derive a contrast transfer function (CTF) for a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging technique based on this movement from the point of view of image formation and continue by performing a two-dimensional integration on the two images based on the two components of the COM movement. The resulting integrated COM (iCOM) STEM technique yields a scalar image that is linear in the phase shift caused by the sample and therefore also in the local (projected) electrostatic potential field of a thin sample. We confirm that the differential phase contrast (DPC) STEM technique using a segmented detector with 4 quadrants (4Q) yields a good approximation for the COM movement. Performing a two-dimensional integration, just as for the COM, we obtain an integrated DPC (iDPC) image which is approximately linear in the phase of the sample. Beside deriving the CTFs of iCOM and iDPC, we clearly point out the objects of the two corresponding imaging techniques, and highlight the differences to objects corresponding to COM-, DPC-, and (HA) ADF-STEM. The theory is validated with simulations and we present first experimental results of the iDPC-STEM technique showing its capability for imaging both light and heavy elements with atomic resolution and a good signal to noise ratio (SNR).},

In this work, we utilize first-principles calculations to investigate 2D InSe/MoSe2(WSe2) vdWHs considering stacking configurations, vertical strain and electric field effects. The results show that the most stable 2D InSe/MoSe2(WSe2) vdWHs possess an intrinsic type-II band alignment. Additionally, the vertical strain not only tunes the band gap but also induces the band alignment transition from type-II to type-I in the vdWHs. Besides, application of external electric field can also transfer the intrinsic type-II band alignment to type-I or type-III. This work predicates the feasibility of 2D InSe/MoSe2(WSe2) vdWHs and extends the applications of 2D InSe materials in the field of optoelectronics.},

The interlayer twist turns into a degree of freedom that alters the properties of the systems of materials, and the realization of moir\'e excitons also offers the feasibility of making artificial exciton crystals. Moreover, moir\'e excitons exhibit many exciting properties under the regulation of various external conditions, including spatial polarisation, alternating dipolar to alternating dipolar moments and gate-dependence to gate voltage dependence; all are pertinent to their applications in nano-photonics and quantum information. But the lag in theoretical development and the low-efficiency of processing technologies significantly limit the potential of moir\'e superlattice applications. In this review, we systematically summarise and discuss the recent progress in moir\'e superlattices and moir\'e excitons, and analyze the current challenges, and put forward relevant recommendations. There is no doubt that further research will lead to breakthroughs in their application and promote reforms and innovations in traditional solid-state physics and materials science.},

Most investigated moir\textbackslash 'e heterostructures are based on van der Waals (vdW) materials, as strong interface interactions typically lead to the formation of strained films or regular surface reconstructions. Here we successfully synthesize ultrathin Sb films, that are predicted to show thickness-dependent topological properties, on semi-insulating InSb(111)A. Despite the covalent nature of the substrate surface, we prove by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that already the first layer of Sb atoms grows completely unstrained, while azimuthally aligned. Rather than compensating the lattice mismatch of -6.4\% by structural modifications, the Sb films form a pronounced moir\textbackslash 'e pattern as we evidence by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) topography up to film thicknesses of several bilayers. Our model calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) assign the moir\textbackslash 'e pattern to a periodic surface corrugation. In agreement with DFT predictions, irrespective of the moir\textbackslash 'e modulation, the topological surface state known on thick Sb film is experimentally confirmed to persist down to low film thicknesses, and the Dirac point shifts towards lower binding energies with decreasing Sb thickness.},

These electric field maps represent the integrated effect of the nucleus, core electrons and valence electrons, and separating their contributions is non-trivial. In this paper, we utilized simultaneously acquired 4D-STEM center of mass (CoM) images and annular dark field (ADF) images to determine the projected electron charge density in monolayer MoS               2               . We evaluate the contributions of both the core electrons and the valence electrons to the derived electron charge density; however, due to blurring by the probe shape, the valence electron contribution forms a nearly featureless background while most of the spatial modulation comes from the core electrons. Our findings highlight the importance of probe shape in interpreting charge densities derived from 4D-STEM and the need for smaller electron probes.},

We specifically analyze holes in phosphorene around the \$\textbackslash Gamma\$ point, at which we find a significant increase of the spin-orbit coupling that can be attributed to the strong hybridization of phosphorene with the WSe\$\_2\$ bands. We also propose an effective spin-orbit model based on the \$\{\textbackslash bf C\}\_\{1\{\textbackslash rm v\}\}\$ symmetry of the studied heterostructure. The corresponding spin-orbit field can be divided into two parts: the in-plane field, present due to the broken nonsymmorphic horizontal glide mirror plane symmetry, and the dominant out-of-plane field triggered by breaking the out-of-plane rotational symmetry of the phosphorene monolayer. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that a heterostructure with 60\$\^\textbackslash circ\$ twist angle exhibits an opposite out-of-plane spin-orbit field, indicating that the coupling can effectively be tuned by twisting. The studied phosphorene/WSe\$\_2\$ bilayer is a prototypical low common-symmetry heterostructure in which the proximity effect can be used to engineer the spin texture of the desired material.},

The van der Waals interface between graphene and MoS2 exhibits a Schottky barrier, thus enabling the possibility of well-defined current rectification. The height of the Schottky barrier can be strongly modulated by an external gate electric field owing to the small density of states of graphene.

A major challenge is the measurement of atomic electric fields using differential phase contrast (DPC) microscopy, traditionally exploiting the concept of a field-induced shift of diffraction patterns. Here we present a simplified quantum theoretical interpretation of DPC. This enables us to calculate the momentum transferred to the STEM probe from diffracted intensities recorded on a pixel array instead of conventional segmented bright-field detectors. The methodical development yielding atomic electric field, charge and electron density is performed using simulations for binary GaN as an ideal model system. We then present a detailed experimental study of SrTiO               3               yielding atomic electric fields, validated by comprehensive simulations. With this interpretation and upgraded instrumentation, STEM is capable of quantifying atomic electric fields and high-contrast imaging of light atoms.},

It has also led to the establishment of a new metrological standard, the resistance quantum. Disappointingly, however, the QHE has been observed only at liquid-helium temperatures. We show that in graphene, in a single atomic layer of carbon, the QHE can be measured reliably even at room temperature, which makes possible QHE resistance standards becoming available to a broader community, outside a few national institutions.},

However, intensity variations caused by dynamical diffraction and sample mistilts can hinder the measurement of diffracted disk centers as necessary for quantification. Robust data processing techniques are needed to provide accurate and precise measurements for complex samples and non-ideal conditions. Here we present an approach to address these challenges using a transform, called the exit wave power cepstrum (EWPC), inspired by cepstral analysis in audio signal processing. The EWPC transforms NBED patterns into real-space patterns with sharp peaks corresponding to inter-atomic spacings. We describe a simple analytical model for interpretation of these patterns that cleanly decouples lattice information from the intensity variations in NBED patterns caused by tilt and thickness. By tracking the inter-atomic spacing peaks in EWPC patterns, strain mapping is demonstrated for two practical applications: mapping of ferroelectric domains in epitaxially strained PbTiO3 films and mapping of strain profiles in arbitrarily oriented core-shell Pt-Co nanoparticle fuel-cell catalysts. The EWPC transform enables lattice structure measurement at sub-pm precision and sub-nm resolution that is robust to small sample mistilts and random orientations.},

Significant energy shifts are observed in tunneling spectra observed at the maxima of the moir\'e corrugation, as compared with spectra obtained at corrugation minima, consistent with prior work. Furthermore, at the minima of the moir\'e corrugation, sharp peaks in the spectra at energies near the band edges are observed for spectra acquired at 5 K. The peaks correspond to discrete states that are confined within the moir\'e unit cells. Conductance mapping is employed to reveal the detailed structure of the wave functions of the states. For measurements at 80 K, the sharp peaks in the spectra are absent, and conductance maps of the band edges reveal little structure.},

However, the required cryogenic temperatures for the functionality of these sources has been an inhibitor of their full potential. Existing methods to create emitters in 2D materials face fundamental challenges in extending the working temperature while maintaining the emitter's fabrication yield and purity. In this work, we demonstrate a method of creating site-controlled single-photon emitters in atomically thin WSe2 with high yield utilizing independent and simultaneous strain engineering via nanoscale stressors and defect engineering via electron-beam irradiation. Many of the emitters exhibit biexciton cascaded emission, single-photon purities above 95\%, and working temperatures up to 150\,K. This methodology, coupled with possible plasmonic or optical micro-cavity integration, furthers the realization of scalable, room-temperature, and high-quality 2D single- and entangled-photon sources.},

Here, we present a versatile approach for creating bright single-photon emitters in WSe2 monolayers by the deposition of gold nanostars. Our molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the formation of the quantum emitters is likely caused by the highly localized strain fields created by the sharp tips of the gold nanostars. The surface plasmon modes supported by the gold nanostars can change the local electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of the quantum emitters, leading to their enhanced emission intensities. Moreover, by correlating the emission energies and intensities of the quantum emitters, we are able to associate them with two types of strain fields and derive the existence of a low-lying dark state in their electronic structures. Our findings are highly relevant for the development and understanding of single-photon emitters in transition metal dichalcogenide materials.},

Here we rely on a hardware aberration corrector to eliminate aberrations, but use the pixelated detector data set to utilize the largest possible volume of Fourier space to create high efficiency phase contrast images. The use of ptychography to diagnose the effects of chromatic aberration is also demonstrated. Finally, the four dimensional dataset is used to compare different bright field detector configurations from the same scan for a sample of bilayer graphene. Our method of high efficiency ptychography produces the clearest images, while annular bright field produces almost no contrast for an in-focus aberrationcorrected probe.},

High in-plane thermal conductivity is due to covalent sp2 bonding between carbon atoms, whereas out-of-plane heat flow is limited by weak van der Waals coupling. Herein, we review the thermal properties of graphene, including its specific heat and thermal conductivity (from diffusive to ballistic limits) and the influence of substrates, defects, and other atomic modifications. We also highlight practical applications in which the thermal properties of graphene play a role. For instance, graphene transistors and interconnects benefit from the high in-plane thermal conductivity, up to a certain channel length. However, weak thermal coupling with substrates implies that interfaces and contacts remain significant dissipation bottlenecks. Heat flow in graphene or graphene composites could also be tunable through a variety of means, including phonon scattering by substrates, edges, or interfaces. Ultimately, the unusual thermal properties of graphene stem from its 2D nature, forming a rich playground for new discoveries of heat-flow physics and potentially leading to novel thermal management applications.},

This can be realized by controlled rotation of adjacent atomic planes, which provides an uncommon way to manipulate inelastic light-matter interactions. Here, we discover an extraordinary blue shift of 5-6 wavenumbers for high-frequency phonon modes in WS2/WSe2 twisted heterobilayers, captured meticulously using Raman spectroscopy. Phonon spectra displace rapidly over a subtle change in interlayer twist angle owing to heterostrain and atomic reconstruction from the Moir\'e pattern. First-order linear coefficients of the phonon modes in twisted heterostructures are further found to increase largely compared to their monolayer counterpart and vary immensely with the twist angle. Exceptional and extravagant enhancement of up to 50-fold is observed in the Raman vibrational intensity at a specific twist angle; this is largely influenced by the resonance process derived from a simple critical twist angle model. In addition, we depict how the resonance can be modulated by changing the thermal conditions and also the stacking angle. Therefore, our work further highlights the twist-driven phonon dynamics in pristine two-dimensional heterostructures, adding vital insight into Moir\'e physics and promoting comprehensive understanding of structural and optical properties in Moir\'e superlattices.},

  abstract = {Isolated atomic planes can be assembled into a multilayer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure in a precisely chosen sequence. These heterostructures feature moir\'e patterns if the constituent 2D material layers are stacked in an incommensurable way, due to a lattice mismatch or twist. This design-by-stacking has opened up the promising area of moir\'e engineering, a term that can be understood in two different perspectives, namely, (i) structural\textemdash engineering a moir\'e pattern by introducing twist, relative strain, or defects that affect the commensurability of the layers and (ii) functional\textemdash exploiting a moir\'e pattern to find and tune resulting physical properties of a vdW heterostructure. The latter meaning, referring to the application of a moir\'e pattern, is seen in the literature in the specific context of the observation of correlated electronic states and unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene. The former meaning, referring to the design of the moir\'e pattern itself, is present in the literature but less commonly discussed or less understood. The underlying link between these two perspectives lies in the deformation field of the moir\'e superlattice. In this Perspective, we describe a path from designing a moir\'e pattern to employing the moir\'e pattern to tune physical properties of a vdW heterostructure. We also discuss the concept of moir\'e engineering in the context of twistronics, strain engineering, and defect engineering in vdW heterostructures. Although twistronics is always associated with moir\'e superlattices, strain and defect engineering are often not. Here, we demonstrate how strain and defect engineering can be understood within the context of moir\'e engineering. Adopting this perspective, we note that moir\'e engineering creates a compelling opportunity to design and develop multiscale electronic devices.},

  abstract = {We present a paradigm for encoding strain into two-dimensional materials (2DMs) to create and deterministically place single-photon emitters (SPEs) in arbitrary locations with nanometer-scale precision. Our material platform consists of a 2DM placed on top of a deformable polymer film. Upon application of sufficient mechanical stress using an atomic force microscope tip, the 2DM/polymer composite deforms, resulting in formation of highly localized strain fields with excellent control and repeatability. We show that SPEs are created and localized at these nanoindents and exhibit single-photon emission up to 60 K, the highest temperature reported in these materials. This quantum calligraphy allows deterministic placement and real time design of arbitrary patterns of SPEs for facile coupling with photonic waveguides, cavities, and plasmonic structures. In addition to enabling versatile placement of SPEs, these results present a general methodology for imparting strain into 2DM with nanometer-scale precision, providing an invaluable tool for further investigations and future applications of strain engineering of 2DM and 2DM devices.},

  abstract = {In twisted bilayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), a combination of structural rippling and electronic coupling gives rise to periodic moir\textbackslash 'e potentials that can confine charged and neutral excitations. Here, we report experimental measurements of the structure and spectroscopic properties of twisted bilayers of WSe2 and MoSe2 in the H-stacking configuration using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Our experiments reveal that the moir\textbackslash 'e potential in these bilayers at small angles is unexpectedly large, reaching values of above 300 meV for the valence band and 150 meV for the conduction band - an order of magnitude larger than theoretical estimates based on interlayer coupling alone. We further demonstrate that the moir\textbackslash 'e potential is a non-monotonic function of moir\textbackslash 'e wavelength, reaching a maximum at around a 13nm moir\textbackslash 'e period. This non-monotonicity coincides with a drastic change in the structure of the moir\textbackslash 'e pattern from a continuous variation of stacking order at small moir\textbackslash 'e wavelengths to a one-dimensional soliton dominated structure at large moir\textbackslash 'e wavelengths. We show that the in-plane structure of the moir\textbackslash 'e pattern is captured well by a continuous mechanical relaxation model, and find that the moir\textbackslash 'e structure and internal strain rather than the interlayer coupling is the dominant factor in determining the moir\textbackslash 'e potential. Our results demonstrate the potential of using precision moir\textbackslash 'e structures to create deeply trapped carriers or excitations for quantum electronics and optoelectronics.},

This is combined with live first moment and further virtual STEM detector analysis. Processing of both real experimental and simulated data shows the characteristics of this method when data are processed progressively, as opposed to the usual offline processing of a complete data set. In particular, the single-sideband method is compared with other techniques such as the enhanced ptychographic engine in order to ascertain its capability for structural imaging at increased specimen thickness. Qualitatively interpretable live results are obtained also if the sample is moved, or magnification is changed during the analysis. This allows live optimization of instrument as well as specimen parameters during the analysis. The methodology is especially expected to improve contrast- and dose-efficient in situ imaging of weakly scattering specimens, where fast live feedback during the experiment is required.},

The in-pixel circuitry provides a 1,000,000:1 dynamic range within a single frame, allowing the direct electron beam to be imaged while still maintaining single electron sensitivity. A 1.1 kHz framing rate enables rapid data collection and minimizes sample drift distortions while scanning. By capturing the entire unsaturated diffraction pattern in scanning mode, one can simultaneously capture bright field, dark field, and phase contrast information, as well as being able to analyze the full scattering distribution, allowing true center of mass imaging. The scattering is recorded on an absolute scale, so that information such as local sample thickness can be directly determined. This paper describes the detector architecture, data acquisition system, and preliminary results from experiments with 80\textendash 200 keV electron beams.},

  abstract = {Edge structures are low-dimensional defects unavoidable in layered materials of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) family. Among the various types of such structures, the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) edge types are the most common. It has been predicted that the presence of intrinsic strain localized along these edges structures can have direct implications for the customization of their electronic properties. However, pinning down the relation between local structure and electronic properties at these edges is challenging. Here, we quantify the local strain field that arises at the edges of MoS2 flakes by combining aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with the geometrical-phase analysis (GPA) method. We also provide further insight on the possible effects of such edge strain on the resulting electronic behavior by means of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements. Our results reveal that the two-dominant edge structures, ZZ and AC, induce the formation of different amounts of localized strain fields. We also show that by varying the free edge curvature from concave to convex, compressive strain turns into tensile strain. These results pave the way toward the customization of edge structures in MoS2, which can be used to engineer the properties of layered materials and thus contribute to the optimization of the next generation of atomic-scale electronic devices built upon them.},

Imaging of TMD moir\'es has so far provided a qualitative understanding of this relaxation process in terms of interlayer stacking energy, while models of the underlying deformation mechanisms have relied on simulations. Here, we use interferometric four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy to quantitatively map the mechanical deformations through which reconstruction occurs in small-angle twisted bilayer MoS               2               and WSe               2               /MoS               2               heterobilayers. We provide direct evidence that local rotations govern relaxation for twisted homobilayers, while local dilations are prominent in heterobilayers possessing a sufficiently large lattice mismatch. Encapsulation of the moir\'e layers in hBN further localizes and enhances these in-plane reconstruction pathways~by suppressing out-of-plane corrugation. We also find that extrinsic uniaxial heterostrain, which introduces a lattice constant difference in twisted homobilayers, leads to accumulation and redistribution of reconstruction strain, demonstrating another route to modify the moir\'e potential.},

The most commonly employed STEM imaging modality of annular dark field produces easily-interpretable contrast, but is dose-inefficient and produces little to no contrast for light elements and weakly-scattering samples. An alternative is to use phase contrast STEM imaging, enabled by high speed detectors able to record full images of a diffracted STEM probe over a grid of scan positions. Phase contrast imaging in STEM is highly dose-efficient, able to measure the structure of beam-sensitive materials and even biological samples. Here, we comprehensively describe the theoretical background, algorithmic implementation details, and perform both simulated and experimental tests for three iterative phase retrieval STEM methods: focused-probe differential phase contrast, defocused-probe parallax imaging, and a generalized ptychographic gradient descent method implemented in two and three dimensions. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of these approaches using a consistent framework to allow for easier comparison. This presentation of STEM phase retrieval methods will make these methods more approachable, reproducible and more readily adoptable for many classes of samples.},

  abstract = {Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) heterostructure with a type II alignment hosts unique interlayer excitons with the possibility of spin-triplet and spin-singlet states. However, the associated spectroscopy signatures remain elusive, strongly hindering the understanding of the Moir\'e potential modulation of the interlayer exciton. In this work, we unambiguously identify the spinsinglet and spin-triplet interlayer excitons in the WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayer with a 60\textdegree{} twist angle through the gate- and magnetic field-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy. Both the singlet and triplet interlayer excitons show giant valley-Zeeman splitting between the K and K{${'}$} valleys, a result of the large Land\'e g-factor of the singlet interlayer exciton and triplet interlayer exciton, which are experimentally determined to be {$\sim$}10.7 and {$\sim$}15.2, respectively, which is in good agreement with theoretical expectation. The photoluminescence (PL) from the singlet and triplet interlayer excitons show opposite helicities, determined by the atomic registry. Helicity-resolved photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy study shows that both singlet and triplet interlayer excitons are highly valleypolarized at the resonant excitation with the valley polarization of the singlet interlayer exciton approaching unity at {$\sim$}20 K. The highly valley-polarized singlet and triplet interlayer excitons with giant valley-Zeeman splitting inspire future applications in spintronics and valleytronics.},

  abstract = {Four-dimensional (4D) scanning transmission electron microscopy is used to study the electric fields at the edges of 2D semiconducting monolayer MoS2. Sub-nanometer 1D features in the 2D electric field maps are observed at the outermost region along zigzag edges and also along nanowire MoS-terminated MoS2 edges. Atomic-scale oscillations are detected in the magnitude of the 1D electromagnetic edge state, with spatial variations that depend on the specific periodic edge reconstructions. Electric field reconstructions, along with integrated differential phase contrast reconstructions, reveal the presence of low Z number atoms terminating many of the uniform edges, which are difficult to detect by annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy due to its limited dynamic range. Density functional theory calculations support the formation of periodic 1D edge states and also show that enhancement of the electric field magnitude can occur for some edge terminations. The experimentally observed electric fields at the edges are attributed to the absence of an opposing electric field from a nearest neighbor atom when the electron beam propagates through the 2D monolayer and interacts. These results show the potential of 4D-STEM to map the atomic scale structure and fluctuations of electric fields around edge atoms with different bonding states than bulk atoms in 2D materials, beyond conventional imaging.},

The influence of twist angle on the excitonic absorption of twisted bilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe\$\_\{2\}\$) has been investigated using electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Atomic-resolution imaging by scanning transmission electron microscopy was used to determine key structural parameters, including the nanoscale measurement of the relative twist angle and stacking order. Detailed spectral analysis revealed a pronounced blueshift in the high-energy excitonic peak C with increasing twist angle, up to 200 meV when compared to the AA\$\^\{\textbackslash prime\}\$ stacking. The experimental findings have been discussed relative to first-principle calculations of the dielectric response of the AA\$\^\{\textbackslash prime\}\$ stacked bilayer WSe\$\_\{2\}\$ as compared to monolayer WSe\$\_\{2\}\$ by employing the \textbackslash textit\{GW\} plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approaches, resolving the origin of higher energy spectral features from ensembles of excitonic transitions, and thus any discrepancies between previous calculations. Furthermore, the electronic structure of moir\textbackslash '\{e\} supercells spanning twist angles of \$\textbackslash sim\$9.5-46.5\$\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ calculated by density functional theory (DFT) were unfolded, showing an uplifting of the conduction band minimum near the \$Q\$ point and minimal change in the upper valence band concurrently. The combined experiment/theory investigation provides valuable insight into the physical origins of high-energy absorption resonances in twisted bilayers, which enables to track the evolution of interlayer coupling from tuning of the exciton C transitions by absorption spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {The heterojunctions based on two\textendash dimensional materials have aroused much research interest as they exhibit excellent properties and can be used in various fields such as catalysis, nanoelectronics, and superconductivity. In this study, the typical MXene monolayer, Zr2CO2, was integrated with the MSe2 (M = Mo and W) monolayers to build van der Waals Zr2CO2/MSe2 bilayers with and without twisted angles. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted at different levels to study the stability, electronic structure, optical absorption spectra, and carrier mobility of the designed bilayers. The BC\textendash stacking Zr2CO2/MSe2 bilayers are energetically favorable and thermodynamically stable. The rotation angle between the Zr2CO2 and MSe2 layers can effectively modulate the band structures by shifting the band edges. The Zr2CO2/WSe2 bilayer with the twisted angle of 46.8{$\smwhtcircle$} has the flat\textendash like bands in the vicinity of the Fermi level with the bandwidths less than 0.1 eV. The BC\textendash stacking Zr2CO2/WSe2 bilayer (Zr2CO2\textendash WSe2\textendash BC) is a type\textendash II heterojunction with an indirect band gap of 1.44 eV. The valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of Zr2CO2\textendash WSe2\textendash BC are dominated by the electronic states of WSe2 and Zr2CO2 layers, respectively. Zr2CO2\textendash WSe2\textendash BC can be considered a favorable candidate photocatalyst for overall water splitting due to its appropriate band structure, spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, improved response to light, and fast carrier mobility.},

We show that vertically stacked graphene\textendash MoS2\textendash graphene and graphene\textendash MoS2\textendash metal junctions can be created with a broad junction area for efficient photon harvesting. The weak electrostatic screening effect of graphene allows the integration of single or dual gates under and/or above the vertical heterostructure to tune the band slope and photocurrent generation. We demonstrate that the amplitude and polarity of the photocurrent in the gated vertical heterostructures can be readily modulated by the electric field of an external gate to achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 55\% and internal quantum efficiency up to 85\%. Our study establishes a method to control photocarrier generation, separation and transport processes using an external electric field.},

Recently, other layered materials such as molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) have been investigated to address this challenge. Here, we report the vertical integration of multi-heterostructures of layered materials for the fabrication of a new generation of vertical field-effect transistors (VFETs) with a room temperature on\textendash off ratio {$>$} 103 and a high current density of up to 5,000\,A\,cm-2. An n-channel VFET is created by sandwiching few-layer MoS2 as the semiconducting channel between a monolayer graphene sheet and a metal thin film. This approach offers a general strategy for the vertical integration of p- and n-channel transistors for high-performance logic applications. As an example, we demonstrate a complementary inverter with a larger-than-unity voltage gain by vertically stacking graphene, Bi2Sr2Co2O8 (p-channel), graphene, MoS2 (n-channel) and a metal thin film in sequence. The ability to simultaneously achieve a high on\textendash off ratio, a high current density and a logic function in such vertically stacked multi-heterostructures can open up possibilities for three-dimensional integration in future electronics.},

To fully understand and control the unique properties of these few-layer materials, a technique that can provide information about their local in-plane structural deformations, twist direction, and out-of-plane structure is needed. In principle, interference in overlap regions of Bragg disks originating from separate layers of a material encodes 3D information about the relative positions of atoms in the corresponding layers. Here, an interferometric 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy technique is described that utilizes this phenomenon to extract precise structural information from few-layer materials with nm-scale resolution. It is demonstrated how this technique enables measurement of local pm-scale in-plane lattice distortions as well as twist direction and average interlayer spacings in bilayer and trilayer graphene, and therefore provides a means to better understand the interplay between electronic properties and precise structural arrangements of few-layer 2D materials.},

While twist angle between the bilayer has been shown to be a critical parameter in engineering the moir\'e potential and enabling novel phenomena in electronic moir\'e systems, a systematic experimental study as a function of twist angle is still missing. Here we show that not only are moir\'e excitons robust in bilayers of even large twist angles, but also properties of the moir\'e excitons are dependant on, and controllable by, the moir\'e reciprocal lattice period via twist-angle tuning. From the twist-angle dependence, we furthermore obtain the effective mass of the interlayer excitons and the electron inter-layer tunneling strength, which are difficult to measure experimentally otherwise.

  abstract = {A secondary moir\'e is developed to solve the measurement error caused by too dense moir\'e when evaluating atomic lattice quality.           ,                             STEM nano-moir\'e can achieve high-precision deformation measurement in a large field of view. In scanning moir\'e fringe technology, the scanning line and magnification of the existing transmission electron microscope (TEM) cannot be changed continuously. The frequency of the crystal lattice is often difficult to match with the fixed frequency of the scanning line, resulting in mostly too dense fringes that cannot be directly observed; thus, the calculation error is relatively large. This problem exists in both the STEM moir\'e method and the multiplication moir\'e method. Herein, we propose the STEM secondary nano-moir\'e method,               i.e.               , a digital grating of similar frequency is superimposed on or sampling the primary moir\'e fringe or multiplication moir\'e to form the secondary moir\'e. The formation principle of the secondary moir\'e is analyzed in detail, with deduced theoretical relations for measuring the strain of STEM secondary nano-moir\'e fringe. The advantages of sampling secondary moir\'e and digital secondary moir\'e are compared. The optimal sampling interpolation function is obtained through error analysis. This method expands the application range of the STEM moir\'e method and has better practicability. Finally, the STEM secondary nano-moir\'e is used to accurately measure the strain field at the Si/Ge heterostructure interface, and the theoretical strain field calculated by the dislocation model is analyzed and compared. The obtained results are more compatible with the P\textendash N dislocation model. Our work provides a practical method for the accurate evaluation of the interface characteristics of heterostructures, which is an important basis for judging the photoelectric performance of the entire device and the optimal design of the heterostructures.},

However, the impact of the moir\'e potential modulation on the number of twisted layers has yet to be experimentally explored. Here, this work synthesizes a twisted WSe               2               homotrilayer using a dry-transfer method and investigates the enhancement of the moir\'e potential with increasing number of twisted layers. The results of the study reveal the presence of multiple exciton resonances with positive or negative circularly polarized emission in the WSe               2               homostructure with small twist angles, which are attributed to the excitonic ground and excited states confined to the moir\'e potential. The distinct               g               -factor observed in the magneto-optical spectroscopy is also shown to be a result of the confinement of the exciton in the moir\'e potential. The moir\'e potential depths of the twisted bilayer and trilayer homostructures are found to be 111 and 212 meV, respectively, an increase of 91\% from the bilayer structure. These findings demonstrate that the depth of the moir\'e potential can be manipulated by adjusting the number of stacked layers, providing a promising avenue for exploration into highly correlated quantum phenomena.},

Nevertheless, a general approach to programming nanoscale morphology in TMD materials, which would permit local strain engineering, has proven elusive. In this work, we propose a general moir\'e-templated nanoscale morphology engineering method based on bilayer TMDs. The moir\'e superlattice plays the key role in enforcing in-plane periodical variations in local interlayer spacing and potential energy. Upon global in-plane compression, the high-energy, large-interlayer-separation stacking domains serve as periodic buckling initiation sites. The buckled features can be thus precisely correlated to the moir\'e periodicity. The spatial profile of the buckled morphology and strain field are possible to be pre-determined, providing a bridge to the electronics and optoelectronics design. We take twisted bilayer MoS               2               to demonstrate our approach. We further demonstrate how the morphology can modulate band gap and optical absorption of a MoS               2               monolayer, envisioned as a potential constituent layer in a Moir\'e-templated, strain-engineered vdW heterostructure of TMDs. The robustness and programmable nature of our approach arise from superlattice symmetry, energetics and mechanics. Our approach provides a new strategy for on-demand design of morphology and local strain in TMDs under mechanical deformation.},

                technique that measures the change in kinetic energy of electrons
                after they have interacted with a specimen. When carried out in a
                modern transmission electron microscope, EELS is capable of
                giving structural and chemical information about a solid, with a
                spatial resolution down to the atomic level in favourable cases.
                The energy resolution is typically 1 eV but can approach 0.1 eV
                if an electron-beam monochromator is used. This review provides
                an overview of EELS instrumentation and of the physics involved

                post-column imaging energy filter became available already in the
                early 1990s. Since then this technique has become an important
                tool for analytic electron microscopy. Nevertheless, the imaging
                performance of post-column energy-filters is undoubtedly inferior
                compared to in-column energy filters and their principal design
                is clearly restricted by practical constraints we found that
                significant improvements with respect to optical performance and
                alignment flexibility are still possible compared to the
                presently available instrumentation. By applying calculation
                methods originally developed for the design of aberration
                correctors and spending much care on the precise design of the
                optical elements and the alignment strategies we could develop a
                new post-column imaging energy filter with a minimalistic and
                robust optical design but remarkable optical properties. Compared
                to other state-of-the-art devices in our design the aberrations
                determining the energy resolution are reduced by one order of
                magnitude for the same entrance aperture. Therefore, if desirable
                , the field of view can be enlarged by more than a factor of two
                in area while the optical aberrations stay comparable or even
                better. We describe the principal optical design of the CEOS
                Energy-Filtering and Imaging Device (CEFID), explain methods for
                aberration measurement and optical characterization, and finally
                demonstrate its optical performance by measured imaging and
                spectroscopy data from two prototype systems.},

                widely used technique in many areas of scientific research. Image
                contrast in energy-filtered images arises from specific
                scattering events such as the ionization of atoms. By combining a
                set of two or more images, relative sample thickness maps or
                elemental distribution maps can be easily created. It is also
                possible to acquire a whole series of energy-filtered images to
                do more complex data analysis. However, whenever several images
                are combined to extract certain information, problems are
                introduced due to sample drift between the exposures. In order to
                obtain artifact-free information, this spatial drift has to be
                taken care of. Manual alignment by overlaying and shifting the
                images to find the best overlap is usually very accurate but
                extremely time consuming for larger data sets. When large amounts
                of images are recorded in an EFTEM series, manual correction is
                no longer a reasonable option. Hence, automatic routines have
                been developed that are mostly based on the cross-correlation
                algorithm. Existing routines, however, sometimes fail and again
                make time consuming manual adjustments necessary. In this paper
                we describe a new approach to the drift correction problem by
                incorporating a statistical treatment of the data and we present
                our statistically determined spatial drift (SDSD) correction
                program. We show its improved performance by applying it to a
                typical EFTEM series data block.},

                in the size and charge of the building elements can make the
                typical 2D layered structure suitable for various applications.
                There is not much flexibility on the chalcogen side{,} as the
                popular elements are S and Se. Following the successful history
                of transition metal sulphides in various applications{,}
                transition metal selenides are now the rising stars. On the
                transition metal side{,} WS2 and WSe2 have recently attracted
                considerable attention. In comparison with the Mo counterparts{,}
                W is more abundant in the Earth{'}s crust and thus cheaper{,} and
                less toxic. The significantly larger size of W atoms can
                substantially tune the TMDC properties. The popularity of
                molybdenum dichalcogenides has somehow overshadowed the
                potentials of tungsten dichalcogenides. This manuscript attempts
                to collect the recent reports on various applications of WS2 and
                WSe2 to provide a general overview of tungsten dichalcogenides.
                Due to the popularity of sulphides{,} the prime focus of the
                present review is on WSe2{,} which is an emerging member of this
                family. Although WTe2 is not a common material like all
                transition metal tellurides{,} it is also briefly reviewed as a
                member of this sub-family of TMDCs owing to its unique properties
                {,} which named it as a potential candidate for giant

abstract = {Abstract 2D van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) and superlattices (SLs) with exotic physical properties and applications for new devices have attracted immense interest. Compared to conventionally bonded heterostructures, the dangling-bond-free surface of 2D layered materials allows for the feasible integration of various materials to produce vdWHs without the requirements of lattice matching and processing compatibility. The quality of interfaces in artificially stacked vdWHs/vdWSLs and scalability of production remain among the major challenges in the field of 2D materials. Fortunately, bottom-up methods exhibit relatively high controllability and flexibility. The growth parameters, such as the temperature, precursors, substrate, and carrier gas, can be carefully and comprehensively controlled to produce high-quality interfaces and wafer-scale products of vdWHs/vdWSLs. This review focuses on three types of bottom-up methods for the assembly of vdWHs and vdWSLs with atomically clean and electronically sharp interfaces: chemical/physical vapor deposition, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, and ultrahigh vacuum growth. These methods can intuitively illustrate the great flexibility and controllability of bottom-up methods for the preparation of vdWHs/vdWSLs. The latest progress in vdWHs and vdWSLs, related physical phenomena, and (opto)electronic devices are summarized. Finally, the authors discuss current challenges and future perspectives in the synthesis and application of vdWHs and vdWSLs.},

With these new materials, truly 2D physics has begun to appear (for instance, the absence of long-range order, 2D excitons, commensurate-incommensurate transition, etc.). Novel heterostructure devices—such as tunneling transistors, resonant tunneling diodes, and light-emitting diodes—are also starting to emerge. Composed from individual 2D crystals, such devices use the properties of those materials to create functionalities that are not accessible in other heterostructures. Here we review the properties of novel 2D crystals and examine how their properties are used in new heterostructure devices.}}

abstract = {The isolation of stable layers of various materials, only an atom or several atoms thick, has provided the opportunity to fabricate devices with novel functionality and to probe fundamental physics. Britnell et al. (p. 1311, published online 2 May; see the Perspective by Hamm and Hess) sandwiched a single layer of the transition metal dichalcogenide WS2 between two sheets of graphene. The photocurrent response of the heterostructure device was enhanced, compared to that of the bare layer of WS2. The prospect of combining single or several-atom-thick layers into heterostructures should help to develop materials with a wide range of properties. Transition metal dichalcogenides sandwiched between two layers of graphene produce an enhanced photoresponse. [Also see Perspective by Hamm and Hess] The isolation of various two-dimensional (2D) materials, and the possibility to combine them in vertical stacks, has created a new paradigm in materials science: heterostructures based on 2D crystals. Such a concept has already proven fruitful for a number of electronic applications in the area of ultrathin and flexible devices. Here, we expand the range of such structures to photoactive ones by using semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)/graphene stacks. Van Hove singularities in the electronic density of states of TMDC guarantees enhanced light-matter interactions, leading to enhanced photon absorption and electron-hole creation (which are collected in transparent graphene electrodes). This allows development of extremely efficient flexible photovoltaic devices with photoresponsivity above 0.1 ampere per watt (corresponding to an external quantum efficiency of above 30\%).}}
