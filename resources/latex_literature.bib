Live processing allows to reconstruct and display the specimen transmission function gradually while diffraction patterns are acquired. For this purpose, we reformulate WDD and apply a dimensionality reduction technique that reduces memory consumption and increases processing speed. We show numerically that this approach maintains the reconstruction quality of specimen transfer functions as well as reduces computational complexity during acquisition processes. Although we only present the reconstruction for scanning transmission electron microscopy datasets, in general, the live processing algorithm we present in this paper can be applied to real-time ptychographic reconstruction for different fields of application.},

We find that the in-plane stiffness of monolayer MoS2 is 180 ( 60 Nm\`A1, corresponding to an effective Young's modulus of 270 ( 100 GPa, which is comparable to that of steel. Breaking occurs at an effective strain between 6 and 11\% with the average breaking strength of 15 ( 3 Nm\`A1 (23 GPa). The strength of strongest monolayer membranes is 11\% of its Young's modulus, corresponding to the upper theoretical limit which indicates that the material can be highly crystalline and almost defect-free.

The breaking of out-of-plane symmetry, along with the spin\textendash orbit coupling, induces Rashba spin-splitting (RSS) in these materials. In this work, RSS in Janus tin dichalcogenide monolayers are studied. In addition, the heterostructures (HSs) of Janus SnXY and WXY (X, Y = S, Se, Te; X {$\not$}= Y) monolayers are discussed. A RSS energy of about 43 meV, more significant than the room temperature energy, is observed in the Janus SnSSe/WSSe HS. The consequences of vertical strain on the semiconducting HS are examined. Compressive vertical strain enhances and tensile strain reduces, the spin-splitting. For the compressive strain of 10.4\%, Janus SnSSe/WSSe HS remains semiconductor with only Rashba bands surrounding near the Fermi level. Enhanced Rashba parameter of about 0.96 eV \AA{} and splitting energy of about 72 meV are observed. These findings confirm that Janus SnSSe/WSSe HS is a productive Rashba material for spintronic device applications.},

Whereas recent experimental studies have confirmed twistangle-dependent optical spectra, the microscopic origin of moir\'e exciton resonances has not been fully clarified yet. Here, we combine first-principles calculations with the excitonic density matrix formalism to study transitions between different moir\'e exciton phases and their impact on optical properties of the twisted MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure. At angles smaller than 2\textdegree, we find flat, moire{\'-} trapped states for inter- and intralayer excitons. This moir\'e exciton phase changes into completely delocalized states at 3\textdegree. We predict a linear and quadratic twist-angle dependence of excitonic resonances for the moire{\'-} trapped and delocalized exciton phases, respectively.},

  abstract = {What does the diffraction pattern from a single atom look like? How does it differ from the scattering from long-range potential? With the development of new high-dynamic range pixel array detectors to measure the complete momentum distribution, these questions have immediate relevance for designing and understanding momentumresolved imaging modes. We explore the asymptotic limits of long-range and shortrange potentials. We use a simple quantum mechanical model to explain the general and asymptotic limits for the probability distribution in both real and reciprocal space. Features in the scattering potential much larger than the probe size cause the bright field (BF) disk to deflect uniformly, while features much smaller than the probe size, instead of a deflection, cause a redistribution of intensity within the BF disk. Because long-range and short-range features are encoded differently in the diffraction pattern, it is possible to separate their contributions in differential phase\textendash contrast (DPC) or center-of-mass (CoM) imaging. The shape profiles for atomic resolution CoM imaging are dominated by the shape of the probe gradient and not the highly singular atomic potentials or their local fields. Instead, only the peak height shows an atomic number sensitivity, whose precise dependence is determined by the convergence angle. At lower convergence angles, the contrast oscillates with increasing atomic number, similar to BF imaging. The range of collection angles impacts DPC and CoM imaging differently, with CoM being more sensitive to the upper cutoff limit, while DPC is more sensitive to the lower cutoff.},

Moreover, controlling the positioning of two-dimensional crystals facilitates their integration in complex devices, which enables the exploration of novel applications and the discovery of new phenomena in these materials. To date, deterministic transfer methods rely on the use of sacrificial polymer layers and wet chemistry to some extent. Here, we develop an all-dry transfer method that relies on viscoelastic stamps and does not employ any wet chemistry step. This is found to be very advantageous to freely suspend these materials as there are no capillary forces involved in the process. Moreover, the whole fabrication process is quick, efficient, clean and it can be performed with high yield.},

An increased electric field is observed around boron monovacancies and subsequently mapped and measured relative to the perfect lattice. The edges of extended defects feature enhanced electric fields, which can be used to trap diffusing adatoms. The magnitude of the electric field produced by the different types of edges is compared to monolayer areas, confirming previous predictions regarding their stability.

At large enough moir\textbackslash 'e lengths, all moir\textbackslash 'e systems relax into commensurated 2D domains separated by networks of dislocation lines. The nodes of the 2D dislocation line network can be considered as vortex-like topological defects. We find that a simple analogy to common topological systems with an \$S\^1\$ order parameter, such as a superconductor or planar ferromagnet, cannot correctly capture the topological nature of these defects. For example, in twisted bilayer graphene, the order parameter space for the relaxed moir\textbackslash 'e system is homotopy equivalent to a punctured torus. Here, the nodes of the 2D dislocation network can be characterized as elements of the fundamental group of the punctured torus, the free group on two generators, endowing these network nodes with non-Abelian properties. Extending this analysis to consider moir\textbackslash 'e patterns generated from any relative strain, we find that antivortices occur in the presence of anisotropic heterostrain, such as shear or anisotropic expansion, while arrays of vortices appear under twist or isotropic expansion between vdW materials. Experimentally, utilizing the dark field imaging capability of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we demonstrate the existence of vortex and antivortex pair formation in a moir\textbackslash 'e system, caused by competition between different types of heterostrains in the vdW interfaces. We also present a methodology for mapping the underlying heterostrain of a moir\textbackslash 'e structure from experimental TEM data, which provides a quantitative relation between the various components of heterostrain and vortex-antivortex density in moir\textbackslash 'e systems.},

  abstract = {Stripped duodenal mucosa of rabbits was mounted in Ussing chambers containing a Ringer solution gassed with 100\% O2. The disappearance of acid or alkali from the mucosal solution of short-circuited tissue was measured with a pH stat while the serosal pH was kept at 7.4. The duodenum rapidly disposed of both acid and alkali; neither property was altered by gassing with N2 while iodoacetate was in the perfusing solutions. Prevention of release of CO2 from the mucosal chamber obliterated the early rapid phase of acid disposal by the mucosa while a similar maneuver in the serosal chamber increased the appearance of serosal acid without altering the rate of acid disposal. Gut sacs of rabbit duodenum in vitro and in vivo showed a positive correlation between acid disposal and the rate of luminal CO2 production. While acid disposal progressively decreased with time for the in vitro gut sacs, the in vivo gut sac showed no fatigue in this respect. Luminal acidification in the Ussing chamber was associated with a profound reduction in short-circuit current (Isc), partially reversible by elevation of the mucosal pH but not by luminal glucose. Our data suggest that acid disposal occurs in part by intraluminal neutralization and in part by diffusion into the mucosa.},

This possibility constitutes the birth of a very active research field on the so-called van der Waals heterostructures. Moreover, these deterministic placement methods also open the door to fabricate complex devices, which would be otherwise very difficult to achieve by conventional bottom-up nanofabrication approaches, and to fabricate fully-encapsulated devices with exquisite electronic properties. The integration of 2D materials with existing technologies such as photonic and superconducting waveguides and fiber optics is another exciting possibility. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of the deterministic placement methods, describing and comparing the different alternative methods available in the literature, and we illustrate their potential to fabricate van der Waals heterostructures, to integrate 2D materials into complex devices and to fabricate artificial bilayer structures where the layers present a user-defined rotational twisting angle.},

The presence of interlayer excitons, where the electron and the hole remain spatially separated in the two layers due to ultrafast charge transfer, is an intriguing feature of these heterostructures. The optoelectronic functionality of 2D heterostructure devices is critically dependent on the relative rotation angle of the layers. However, the role of the relative rotation angle of the constituent layers on intralayer absorption is not clear yet. Here, we investigate MoS2/WSe2 vdW heterostructures using monochromated low-loss electron energy loss (EEL) spectroscopy combined with aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and report that momentum conservation is a critical factor in the intralayer absorption of TMDC vdW heterostructures. The evolution of the intralayer excitonic low-loss EEL spectroscopy peak broadenings as a function of the rotation angle reveals that the interlayer charge transfer rate can be about an order of magnitude faster in the aligned (or anti-aligned) case than in the misaligned cases. These results provide a deeper insight into the role of momentum conservation, one of the fundamental principles governing charge transfer dynamics in 2D vdW heterostructures.},

Therefore, searching for novel 2D TMD materials with long timescale of carrier lifetime becomes one of the most important topics. Here, based on the timedomain density functional theory (TD-DFT), we propose a brand new TMD material, namely janus-MoSTe, which exhibits a strong build-in electric field. Our results show that in janus-MoSTe monolayer, the exciton consisting of electron and hole has a relatively wide spatial extension and low binding energy. In addition, a slow electron-hole recombination process is observed, with timescale on the order of 1.31 ns, which is even comparable with those of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. Further analysis reveals that the extremely long timescale for electron-hole recombination could be ascribed to the strong Coulomb screening effect as well as the small overlap of wavefunctions between electrons and holes. Our findings establish the build-in electric field as an effective factor to control the electron-hole recombination dynamics in TMD monolayers and facilitate their future applications in light detecting and harvesting.},

Furthermore, the combination of this incoherent imaging technique with EELS allows us to correlate certain structural features, such as defects or interfaces directly with the measured changes in the local electronic fine-structure. In this review, we will discuss the experimental procedures for achieving high-resolution Z-contrast imaging and EELS. We will describe the alignment and experimental setup for high-resolution STEM analysis and also describe some of our recent results where the combined use of atomicresolution Z-contrast imaging and column-by-column EELS has helped solve important materials science problems.},

Here we present an alternative polymer-assisted and mechanicalexfoliation-based sample preparation method and demonstrate it on selected oxidation-sensitive transition metal phosphorus trisulfides and transition metal dichalcogenides. The analysis, obtained from the samples prepared with both of the methods clearly show that oxidation is the origin of discrepancy, the oxidation during the final preparation step is strongly reduced only when the new method is applied, and atomically-resolved structural characterization of the pristine structures is now possible.},

  abstract = {We developed a contact inking technique for microcontact printing aiming at the fabrication of conductive silver-nanoparticle (Ag NP) lines with rectangular cross section and constant layer thickness, irrespective of pattern size and shape. In the proposed process, Ag NP ink was first coated on a blanket and then inking was carried out by a contact with a microcontact stamp. The ink transferred atop of the stamp was finally settled on a workpiece by pressing to complete the printing process. To achieve robust inking to the stamp, the peel strengths between the Ag NP layer and the blankets and between the Ag NP layer and the stamp were investigated using poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) materials with different surface energies. Interestingly, it was revealed that the transferability of Ag NP from the blanket toward the stamp was not solely determined by the surface energy difference but also by the extent of solvent uptake by the PDMS blanket during inking. The solvent-containing PDMS significantly lowered its adhesion strength against adjacent ink layers and, as a consequence, the ink transfer was successfully achieved even in case the ink passed from a higher to a lower energy surface. Furthermore, by the solvent-vapour annealing of contact-inked semi-dried patterns, arbitrarily iterated transfers between PDMS surfaces became possible. With the contact-inking process developed here, we demonstrate a finely defined printed structure of Ag NP conductive lines with width of up to 1 {$\mu$}m.},

The required understanding of the intricate relationship between nanoscale crystal structure and the properties of the resulting plasmonic resonances remains, however, elusive for these materials. Specifically, edge- and surface-induced plasmonic resonances, and other collective excitations, are often buried beneath the continuum of electronic transitions, making it difficult to isolate and interpret these signals using techniques such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Here we focus on the experimentally clean energy-gain EELS region to characterise collective excitations in the topologically insulating material Bi2Te3 and correlate them with the underlying crystalline structure with nanoscale resolution. We identify with high significance the presence of a distinct energy-gain peak around -0.8 eV, with spatially-resolved maps revealing that its intensity is markedly enhanced at the edge regions of the specimen. Our findings illustrate the reach of energy-gain EELS analyses to accurately map collective excitations in quantum materials, a key asset in the quest towards new tunable plasmonic devices.},

The transferred graphene films have high electrical conductivity and high optical transmittance that make them suitable for transparent conductive electrode applications.

The interlayer twist turns into a degree of freedom that alters the properties of the systems of materials, and the realization of moir\'e excitons also offers the feasibility of making artificial exciton crystals. Moreover, moir\'e excitons exhibit many exciting properties under the regulation of various external conditions, including spatial polarisation, alternating dipolar to alternating dipolar moments and gate-dependence to gate voltage dependence; all are pertinent to their applications in nano-photonics and quantum information. But the lag in theoretical development and the low-efficiency of processing technologies significantly limit the potential of moir\'e superlattice applications. In this review, we systematically summarise and discuss the recent progress in moir\'e superlattices and moir\'e excitons, and analyze the current challenges, and put forward relevant recommendations. There is no doubt that further research will lead to breakthroughs in their application and promote reforms and innovations in traditional solid-state physics and materials science.},

Most investigated moir\textbackslash 'e heterostructures are based on van der Waals (vdW) materials, as strong interface interactions typically lead to the formation of strained films or regular surface reconstructions. Here we successfully synthesize ultrathin Sb films, that are predicted to show thickness-dependent topological properties, on semi-insulating InSb(111)A. Despite the covalent nature of the substrate surface, we prove by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that already the first layer of Sb atoms grows completely unstrained, while azimuthally aligned. Rather than compensating the lattice mismatch of -6.4\% by structural modifications, the Sb films form a pronounced moir\textbackslash 'e pattern as we evidence by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) topography up to film thicknesses of several bilayers. Our model calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) assign the moir\textbackslash 'e pattern to a periodic surface corrugation. In agreement with DFT predictions, irrespective of the moir\textbackslash 'e modulation, the topological surface state known on thick Sb film is experimentally confirmed to persist down to low film thicknesses, and the Dirac point shifts towards lower binding energies with decreasing Sb thickness.},

These electric field maps represent the integrated effect of the nucleus, core electrons and valence electrons, and separating their contributions is non-trivial. In this paper, we utilized simultaneously acquired 4D-STEM center of mass (CoM) images and annular dark field (ADF) images to determine the projected electron charge density in monolayer MoS               2               . We evaluate the contributions of both the core electrons and the valence electrons to the derived electron charge density; however, due to blurring by the probe shape, the valence electron contribution forms a nearly featureless background while most of the spatial modulation comes from the core electrons. Our findings highlight the importance of probe shape in interpreting charge densities derived from 4D-STEM and the need for smaller electron probes.},

We also propose an effective spin-orbit model based on the \$\{\textbackslash bf C\}\_\{1\{\textbackslash rm v\}\}\$ symmetry of the studied heterostructure. The corresponding spin-orbit field can be divided into two parts: the in-plane field, present due to the broken nonsymmorphic horizontal glide mirror plane symmetry, and the dominant out-of-plane field triggered by breaking the out-of-plane rotational symmetry of the phosphorene monolayer. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that a heterostructure with 60\$\^\textbackslash circ\$ twist angle exhibits an opposite out-of-plane spin-orbit field, indicating that the coupling can effectively be tuned by twisting. The studied phosphorene/WSe\$\_2\$ bilayer is a prototypical low common-symmetry heterostructure in which the proximity effect can be used to engineer the spin texture of the desired material.},

We reveal that adventitious impurities of C, N, and O can substitute into the NbSe2 lattice stabilizing Se divacancies. We further observe evidence of Pt substitution into both Se and Nb vacancy sites.

  abstract = {Scanning nanobeam electron diffraction (NBED) with fast pixelated detectors is a valuable technique for rapid, spatially resolved mapping of lattice structure over a wide range of length scales. However, intensity variations caused by dynamical diffraction and sample mistilts can hinder the measurement of diffracted disk centers as necessary for quantification. Robust data processing techniques are needed to provide accurate and precise measurements for complex samples and non-ideal conditions. Here we present an approach to address these challenges using a transform, called the exit wave power cepstrum (EWPC), inspired by cepstral analysis in audio signal processing. The EWPC transforms NBED patterns into real-space patterns with sharp peaks corresponding to inter-atomic spacings. We describe a simple analytical model for interpretation of these patterns that cleanly decouples lattice information from the intensity variations in NBED patterns caused by tilt and thickness. By tracking the inter-atomic spacing peaks in EWPC patterns, strain mapping is demonstrated for two practical applications: mapping of ferroelectric domains in epitaxially strained PbTiO3 films and mapping of strain profiles in arbitrarily oriented core-shell Pt-Co nanoparticle fuel-cell catalysts. The EWPC transform enables lattice structure measurement at sub-pm precision and sub-nm resolution that is robust to small sample mistilts and random orientations.},

Significant energy shifts are observed in tunneling spectra observed at the maxima of the moir\'e corrugation, as compared with spectra obtained at corrugation minima, consistent with prior work. Furthermore, at the minima of the moir\'e corrugation, sharp peaks in the spectra at energies near the band edges are observed for spectra acquired at 5 K. The peaks correspond to discrete states that are confined within the moir\'e unit cells. Conductance mapping is employed to reveal the detailed structure of the wave functions of the states. For measurements at 80 K, the sharp peaks in the spectra are absent, and conductance maps of the band edges reveal little structure.},

Ptychography has previously been used to provide super-resolution beyond the diffraction limit of the optics, alongside numerically correcting for spherical aberration. Here we rely on a hardware aberration corrector to eliminate aberrations, but use the pixelated detector data set to utilize the largest possible volume of Fourier space to create high efficiency phase contrast images. The use of ptychography to diagnose the effects of chromatic aberration is also demonstrated. Finally, the four dimensional dataset is used to compare different bright field detector configurations from the same scan for a sample of bilayer graphene. Our method of high efficiency ptychography produces the clearest images, while annular bright field produces almost no contrast for an in-focus aberrationcorrected probe.},

  abstract = {Twisted van der Waals heterostructures are known to induce surprisingly diverse and intriguing phenomena, such as correlated electronic phase and unconventional optical properties. This can be realized by controlled rotation of adjacent atomic planes, which provides an uncommon way to manipulate inelastic light-matter interactions. Here, we discover an extraordinary blue shift of 5-6 wavenumbers for high-frequency phonon modes in WS2/WSe2 twisted heterobilayers, captured meticulously using Raman spectroscopy. Phonon spectra displace rapidly over a subtle change in interlayer twist angle owing to heterostrain and atomic reconstruction from the Moir\'e pattern. First-order linear coefficients of the phonon modes in twisted heterostructures are further found to increase largely compared to their monolayer counterpart and vary immensely with the twist angle. Exceptional and extravagant enhancement of up to 50-fold is observed in the Raman vibrational intensity at a specific twist angle; this is largely influenced by the resonance process derived from a simple critical twist angle model. In addition, we depict how the resonance can be modulated by changing the thermal conditions and also the stacking angle. Therefore, our work further highlights the twist-driven phonon dynamics in pristine two-dimensional heterostructures, adding vital insight into Moir\'e physics and promoting comprehensive understanding of structural and optical properties in Moir\'e superlattices.},

  abstract = {Isolated atomic planes can be assembled into a multilayer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure in a precisely chosen sequence. These heterostructures feature moir\'e patterns if the constituent 2D material layers are stacked in an incommensurable way, due to a lattice mismatch or twist. This design-by-stacking has opened up the promising area of moir\'e engineering, a term that can be understood in two different perspectives, namely, (i) structural\textemdash engineering a moir\'e pattern by introducing twist, relative strain, or defects that affect the commensurability of the layers and (ii) functional\textemdash exploiting a moir\'e pattern to find and tune resulting physical properties of a vdW heterostructure. The latter meaning, referring to the application of a moir\'e pattern, is seen in the literature in the specific context of the observation of correlated electronic states and unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene. The former meaning, referring to the design of the moir\'e pattern itself, is present in the literature but less commonly discussed or less understood. The underlying link between these two perspectives lies in the deformation field of the moir\'e superlattice. In this Perspective, we describe a path from designing a moir\'e pattern to employing the moir\'e pattern to tune physical properties of a vdW heterostructure. We also discuss the concept of moir\'e engineering in the context of twistronics, strain engineering, and defect engineering in vdW heterostructures. Although twistronics is always associated with moir\'e superlattices, strain and defect engineering are often not. Here, we demonstrate how strain and defect engineering can be understood within the context of moir\'e engineering. Adopting this perspective, we note that moir\'e engineering creates a compelling opportunity to design and develop multiscale electronic devices.},

  abstract = {In twisted bilayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), a combination of structural rippling and electronic coupling gives rise to periodic moir\textbackslash 'e potentials that can confine charged and neutral excitations. Here, we report experimental measurements of the structure and spectroscopic properties of twisted bilayers of WSe2 and MoSe2 in the H-stacking configuration using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Our experiments reveal that the moir\textbackslash 'e potential in these bilayers at small angles is unexpectedly large, reaching values of above 300 meV for the valence band and 150 meV for the conduction band - an order of magnitude larger than theoretical estimates based on interlayer coupling alone. We further demonstrate that the moir\textbackslash 'e potential is a non-monotonic function of moir\textbackslash 'e wavelength, reaching a maximum at around a 13nm moir\textbackslash 'e period. This non-monotonicity coincides with a drastic change in the structure of the moir\textbackslash 'e pattern from a continuous variation of stacking order at small moir\textbackslash 'e wavelengths to a one-dimensional soliton dominated structure at large moir\textbackslash 'e wavelengths. We show that the in-plane structure of the moir\textbackslash 'e pattern is captured well by a continuous mechanical relaxation model, and find that the moir\textbackslash 'e structure and internal strain rather than the interlayer coupling is the dominant factor in determining the moir\textbackslash 'e potential. Our results demonstrate the potential of using precision moir\textbackslash 'e structures to create deeply trapped carriers or excitations for quantum electronics and optoelectronics.},

Processing of both real experimental and simulated data shows the characteristics of this method when data are processed progressively, as opposed to the usual offline processing of a complete data set. In particular, the single-sideband method is compared with other techniques such as the enhanced ptychographic engine in order to ascertain its capability for structural imaging at increased specimen thickness. Qualitatively interpretable live results are obtained also if the sample is moved, or magnification is changed during the analysis. This allows live optimization of instrument as well as specimen parameters during the analysis.

The in-pixel circuitry provides a 1,000,000:1 dynamic range within a single frame, allowing the direct electron beam to be imaged while still maintaining single electron sensitivity. A 1.1 kHz framing rate enables rapid data collection and minimizes sample drift distortions while scanning. By capturing the entire unsaturated diffraction pattern in scanning mode, one can simultaneously capture bright field, dark field, and phase contrast information, as well as being able to analyze the full scattering distribution, allowing true center of mass imaging. The scattering is recorded on an absolute scale, so that information such as local sample thickness can be directly determined.

  abstract = {Edge structures are low-dimensional defects unavoidable in layered materials of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) family. Among the various types of such structures, the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) edge types are the most common. It has been predicted that the presence of intrinsic strain localized along these edges structures can have direct implications for the customization of their electronic properties. However, pinning down the relation between local structure and electronic properties at these edges is challenging. Here, we quantify the local strain field that arises at the edges of MoS2 flakes by combining aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with the geometrical-phase analysis (GPA) method. We also provide further insight on the possible effects of such edge strain on the resulting electronic behavior by means of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements. Our results reveal that the two-dominant edge structures, ZZ and AC, induce the formation of different amounts of localized strain fields. We also show that by varying the free edge curvature from concave to convex, compressive strain turns into tensile strain. These results pave the way toward the customization of edge structures in MoS2, which can be used to engineer the properties of layered materials and thus contribute to the optimization of the next generation of atomic-scale electronic devices built upon them.},

Imaging of TMD moir\'es has so far provided a qualitative understanding of this relaxation process in terms of interlayer stacking energy, while models of the underlying deformation mechanisms have relied on simulations. Here, we use interferometric four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy to quantitatively map the mechanical deformations through which reconstruction occurs in small-angle twisted bilayer MoS               2               and WSe               2               /MoS               2               heterobilayers.

Encapsulation of the moir\'e layers in hBN further localizes and enhances these in-plane reconstruction pathways~by suppressing out-of-plane corrugation. We also find that extrinsic uniaxial heterostrain, which introduces a lattice constant difference in twisted homobilayers, leads to accumulation and redistribution of reconstruction strain, demonstrating another route to modify the moir\'e potential.},

Sub-nanometer 1D features in the 2D electric field maps are observed at the outermost region along zigzag edges and also along nanowire MoS-terminated MoS2 edges. Atomic-scale oscillations are detected in the magnitude of the 1D electromagnetic edge state, with spatial variations that depend on the specific periodic edge reconstructions. Electric field reconstructions, along with integrated differential phase contrast reconstructions, reveal the presence of low Z number atoms terminating many of the uniform edges, which are difficult to detect by annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy due to its limited dynamic range. Density functional theory calculations support the formation of periodic 1D edge states and also show that enhancement of the electric field magnitude can occur for some edge terminations. The experimentally observed electric fields at the edges are attributed to the absence of an opposing electric field from a nearest neighbor atom when the electron beam propagates through the 2D monolayer and interacts. These results show the potential of 4D-STEM to map the atomic scale structure and fluctuations of electric fields around edge atoms with different bonding states than bulk atoms in 2D materials, beyond conventional imaging.},

The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted at different levels to study the stability, electronic structure, optical absorption spectra, and carrier mobility of the designed bilayers. The BC\textendash stacking Zr2CO2/MSe2 bilayers are energetically favorable and thermodynamically stable. The rotation angle between the Zr2CO2 and MSe2 layers can effectively modulate the band structures by shifting the band edges. The Zr2CO2/WSe2 bilayer with the twisted angle of 46.8{$\smwhtcircle$} has the flat\textendash like bands in the vicinity of the Fermi level with the bandwidths less than 0.1 eV. The BC\textendash stacking Zr2CO2/WSe2 bilayer (Zr2CO2\textendash WSe2\textendash BC) is a type\textendash II heterojunction with an indirect band gap of 1.44 eV. The valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of Zr2CO2\textendash WSe2\textendash BC are dominated by the electronic states of WSe2 and Zr2CO2 layers, respectively. Zr2CO2\textendash WSe2\textendash BC can be considered a favorable candidate photocatalyst for overall water splitting due to its appropriate band structure, spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, improved response to light, and fast carrier mobility.},

In this paper we explore the technique more quantitatively using theory and simulations. Compared to other STEM phase contrast modes including annular bright field (ABF) and differential phase contrast (DPC), we show that the ptychographic phase reconstruction method using pixelated detectors offers the highest contrast transfer efficiency and superior low dose performance. Applying the ptychographic reconstruction method to DPC segmented detectors also improves the detector contrast transfer and results in less noisy images than DPC images formed using difference signals. We also find that using a minimum array of 16 \^A 16 pixels is sufficient to provide the highest signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) for imaging beam sensitive weak phase objects. Finally, the convergence angle can be adjusted to enhance the contrast transfer based on the spatial frequencies of the specimen under study. \& 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In Part I of this series of two papers, we demonstrated the formation of a high efficiency phase-contrast image at atomic resolution using a pixelated detector in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) with ptychography. In this paper we explore the technique more quantitatively using theory and simulations. Compared to other STEM phase contrast modes including annular bright field (ABF) and differential phase contrast (DPC), we show that the ptychographic phase reconstruction method using pixelated detectors offers the highest contrast transfer efficiency and superior low dose performance. Applying the ptychographic reconstruction method to DPC segmented detectors also improves the detector contrast transfer and results in less noisy images than DPC images formed using difference signals. We also find that using a minimum array of 16 \^A 16 pixels is sufficient to provide the highest signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) for imaging beam sensitive weak phase objects. Finally, the convergence angle can be adjusted to enhance the contrast transfer based on the spatial frequencies of the specimen under study. \& 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To fully understand and control the unique properties of these few-layer materials, a technique that can provide information about their local in-plane structural deformations, twist direction, and out-of-plane structure is needed. In principle, interference in overlap regions of Bragg disks originating from separate layers of a material encodes 3D information about the relative positions of atoms in the corresponding layers. Here, an interferometric 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy technique is described that utilizes this phenomenon to extract precise structural information from few-layer materials with nm-scale resolution. It is demonstrated how this technique enables measurement of local pm-scale in-plane lattice distortions as well as twist direction and average interlayer spacings in bilayer and trilayer graphene, and therefore provides a means to better understand the interplay between electronic properties and precise structural arrangements of few-layer 2D materials.},

With rotational alignment, the lattice mismatch leads to a periodic variation of atomic registry between individual van der Waals layers, exhibiting a Moir\'e pattern with a well-defined periodicity. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and first-principles calculations, we investigate interlayer coupling as a function of atomic registry. We quantitatively determine the influence of interlayer coupling on the electronic structure of the hetero-bilayer at different critical points. We show that the direct gap semiconductor concept is retained in the bilayer although the valence and conduction band edges are located at different layers.

While twist angle between the bilayer has been shown to be a critical parameter in engineering the moir\'e potential and enabling novel phenomena in electronic moir\'e systems, a systematic experimental study as a function of twist angle is still missing. Here we show that not only are moir\'e excitons robust in bilayers of even large twist angles, but also properties of the moir\'e excitons are dependant on, and controllable by, the moir\'e reciprocal lattice period via twist-angle tuning. From the twist-angle dependence, we furthermore obtain the effective mass of the interlayer excitons and the electron inter-layer tunneling strength, which are difficult to measure experimentally otherwise. These findings pave the way for understanding and engineering rich moir\'e-lattice induced phenomena in angle-twisted semiconductor van der Waals heterostructures.},

In scanning moir\'e fringe technology, the scanning line and magnification of the existing transmission electron microscope (TEM) cannot be changed continuously. The frequency of the crystal lattice is often difficult to match with the fixed frequency of the scanning line, resulting in mostly too dense fringes that cannot be directly observed; thus, the calculation error is relatively large. This problem exists in both the STEM moir\'e method and the multiplication moir\'e method. Herein, we propose the STEM secondary nano-moir\'e method,               i.e.               , a digital grating of similar frequency is superimposed on or sampling the primary moir\'e fringe or multiplication moir\'e to form the secondary moir\'e. The formation principle of the secondary moir\'e is analyzed in detail, with deduced theoretical relations for measuring the strain of STEM secondary nano-moir\'e fringe. The advantages of sampling secondary moir\'e and digital secondary moir\'e are compared. The optimal sampling interpolation function is obtained through error analysis. This method expands the application range of the STEM moir\'e method and has better practicability. Finally, the STEM secondary nano-moir\'e is used to accurately measure the strain field at the Si/Ge heterostructure interface, and the theoretical strain field calculated by the dislocation model is analyzed and compared. The obtained results are more compatible with the P\textendash N dislocation model. Our work provides a practical method for the accurate evaluation of the interface characteristics of heterostructures, which is an important basis for judging the photoelectric performance of the entire device and the optimal design of the heterostructures.},

Nevertheless, a general approach to programming nanoscale morphology in TMD materials, which would permit local strain engineering, has proven elusive. In this work, we propose a general moir\'e-templated nanoscale morphology engineering method based on bilayer TMDs. The moir\'e superlattice plays the key role in enforcing in-plane periodical variations in local interlayer spacing and potential energy. Upon global in-plane compression, the high-energy, large-interlayer-separation stacking domains serve as periodic buckling initiation sites. The buckled features can be thus precisely correlated to the moir\'e periodicity. The spatial profile of the buckled morphology and strain field are possible to be pre-determined, providing a bridge to the electronics and optoelectronics design. We take twisted bilayer MoS               2               to demonstrate our approach. We further demonstrate how the morphology can modulate band gap and optical absorption of a MoS               2               monolayer, envisioned as a potential constituent layer in a Moir\'e-templated, strain-engineered vdW heterostructure of TMDs. The robustness and programmable nature of our approach arise from superlattice symmetry, energetics and mechanics. Our approach provides a new strategy for on-demand design of morphology and local strain in TMDs under mechanical deformation.},

                spectroscopy and electron spectroscopic imaging in transmission
                electron microscopy have a long history. The first commercial
                post-column imaging energy filter became available already in the
                early 1990s. Since then this technique has become an important
                tool for analytic electron microscopy. Nevertheless, the imaging
                performance of post-column energy-filters is undoubtedly inferior
                compared to in-column energy filters and their principal design
                is clearly restricted by practical constraints we found that
                significant improvements with respect to optical performance and
                alignment flexibility are still possible compared to the
                presently available instrumentation. By applying calculation
                methods originally developed for the design of aberration
                correctors and spending much care on the precise design of the
                optical elements and the alignment strategies we could develop a
                new post-column imaging energy filter with a minimalistic and
                robust optical design but remarkable optical properties. Compared
                to other state-of-the-art devices in our design the aberrations
                determining the energy resolution are reduced by one order of
                magnitude for the same entrance aperture. Therefore, if desirable
                , the field of view can be enlarged by more than a factor of two
                in area while the optical aberrations stay comparable or even
                better. We describe the principal optical design of the CEOS
                Energy-Filtering and Imaging Device (CEFID), explain methods for
                aberration measurement and optical characterization, and finally
                demonstrate its optical performance by measured imaging and
                spectroscopy data from two prototype systems.},

                spectroscopy (EELS) requires reliable access to the low-loss
                region where the zero-loss peak (ZLP) often overwhelms the
                contributions associated to inelastic scatterings off the
                specimen. Here we deploy machine learning techniques developed in
                particle physics to realise a model-independent, multidimensional
                determination of the ZLP with a faithful uncertainty estimate.
                This novel method is then applied to subtract the ZLP for EEL
                spectra acquired in flower-like WS2 nanostructures characterised
                by a 2H/3R mixed polytypism. From the resulting subtracted
                spectra we determine the nature and value of the bandgap of
                polytypic WS2, finding EBG=1.6−0.2+0.3eV with a clear preference
                for an indirect bandgap. Further, we demonstrate how this method
                enables us to robustly identify excitonic transitions down to
                very small energy losses. Our approach has been implemented and
                made available in an open source Python package dubbed

                widely used technique in many areas of scientific research. Image
                contrast in energy-filtered images arises from specific
                scattering events such as the ionization of atoms. By combining a
                set of two or more images, relative sample thickness maps or
                elemental distribution maps can be easily created. It is also
                possible to acquire a whole series of energy-filtered images to
                do more complex data analysis. However, whenever several images
                are combined to extract certain information, problems are
                introduced due to sample drift between the exposures. In order to
                obtain artifact-free information, this spatial drift has to be
                taken care of. Manual alignment by overlaying and shifting the
                images to find the best overlap is usually very accurate but
                extremely time consuming for larger data sets. When large amounts
                of images are recorded in an EFTEM series, manual correction is
                no longer a reasonable option. Hence, automatic routines have
                been developed that are mostly based on the cross-correlation
                algorithm. Existing routines, however, sometimes fail and again
                make time consuming manual adjustments necessary. In this paper
                we describe a new approach to the drift correction problem by
                incorporating a statistical treatment of the data and we present
                our statistically determined spatial drift (SDSD) correction
                program. We show its improved performance by applying it to a
                typical EFTEM series data block.},

                of transition metal sulphides in various applications{,}
                transition metal selenides are now the rising stars. On the
                transition metal side{,} WS2 and WSe2 have recently attracted
                considerable attention. In comparison with the Mo counterparts{,}
                W is more abundant in the Earth{'}s crust and thus cheaper{,} and
                less toxic. The significantly larger size of W atoms can
                substantially tune the TMDC properties. The popularity of
                molybdenum dichalcogenides has somehow overshadowed the
                potentials of tungsten dichalcogenides. This manuscript attempts
                to collect the recent reports on various applications of WS2 and
                WSe2 to provide a general overview of tungsten dichalcogenides.
                Due to the popularity of sulphides{,} the prime focus of the
                present review is on WSe2{,} which is an emerging member of this
                family. Although WTe2 is not a common material like all
                transition metal tellurides{,} it is also briefly reviewed as a
                member of this sub-family of TMDCs owing to its unique properties
                {,} which named it as a potential candidate for giant
                magnetoresistance and superconductivity.",
