\chapter*{Abstract}
This report focusses on utilising scanning transmission electron microscopy in conjunction with a cutting-edge, high dynamic range direct electron detector to acquire precise and localised information on stamped moir√© heterostructures. The innovative electron microscope pixelated array detector is employed to capture diffraction data from small areas of heterostructure lattices, generating a four-dimensional dataset. These datasets enable the mapping of strain, electrical, and potential fields with micrometre and nanometre level precision. A novel centre-of-mass analysis approach is developed and integrated into an existing dataset exploration framework for rapid experimentation during electron microscope data acquisition.
